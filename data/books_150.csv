8,8,9343542755612,"100 Novels That Changed the World: An inspiring journey through history’s most important literature, the perfect gift for book lovers and academics","A look at 100 inspiring novels that have left a significant mark on the world of literature and popular culture.
Before the novel, the world of books was dominated by scientific tomes, religious tracts and histories of the victorious in war. There had been stories and epic poems from ancient times – Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey recounted ancient Greece, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was a chivalric romance in Middle English, but it was not until the seventeenth century, when the European middle classes had money and leisure, that anything so frivolous as a novel could be sold for entertainment.
Colin Salter traces the evolution of the novel from the earliest examples through to the postmodernist best-sellers of the 21st century. Rather than dwelling too long on the technical nuances of innovative writing style he has amassed 100 of the greatest novel writers and chosen their most significant work.
For writers such as Herman Melville, James Joyce or Harper Lee the decision is not a difficult one. For Charles Dickens, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, the choice is perhaps more difficult.
Following the style set with previous books in the 100 series, most notably 100 Children’s Books and 100 Science Discoveries, each author is given a concise biography and their major novel analysed and then set in context with their other published work.
Readers can become ridiculously well-read in 224 pages.

40,40,9344866418972,1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed: Revised and Updated (Turning Points in Ancient History Book 1),"A bold reassessment of what caused the Late Bronze Age collapseIn 1177 B.C., marauding groups known only as the ""Sea Peoples"" invaded Egypt. The pharaoh's army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen?In this major new account of the causes of this ""First Dark Ages,"" Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries.A compelling combination of narrative and the latest scholarship, 1177 B.C. sheds new light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and ultimately destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age—and that set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece.",Eric H.

44,44,9344829292828,17 MINUTI: L'Eternità non ha più fretta (Italian Edition),"17 minuti per attraversare una piccola città della provincia siciliana. 17 minuti per dare un calcio a un tempo che sembra non passare mai e che ci opprime con la sua immobilità. 17 minuti per dire addio a chi si ama. 
Un testo teatrale che mette in primo piano una classe di ragazzi. I loro sogni a metà strada fra l'entusiasmo adolescenziale e il disincanto verso un futuro che sembra non avere speranze da offrire. Il vuoto di valori rappresentato da un professore immaturo e vanesio e dai silenzi di adulti che hanno dimenticato il proprio ruolo nella società. Nessuna educazione, nessun esempio, nessun maestro per la nuova Europa. La scuola della vita si fa sul campo e la velocità è ormai l'ultimo dio. Correre, correre, correre sempre più veloce per non restare indietro. Andare avanti e non voltarsi è l'imperativo. Correre per inerzia senza chiedersi se c'è un traguardo è la scelta obbligata. E per chi si rifiuta di cedere al nuovo diktat dell'Era contemporanea non resta che la derisione del Mondo. 17 minuti basteranno per comprendere quale sia il senso della corsa? Chissà. Sicuramente serviranno a svelare che l'Eternità non ha più fretta.

Silent. Gruff. Always ready to expect the worst, especially at gatherings. He rarely bothers to explain himself, with a touch of bitterness in every step.
Since her father had been turned away from a ball and humiliated in her childhood, Miss Lavender Latrice had been consumed with one thing and one thing—becoming a part of the nobility that had scorned them.
But while wealth could buy some things, a title surely wasn’t one of them.
Or at least that’s what Lavender believed until her brother stumbled upon a near-penniless bare-knuckle boxer—one Austin Thomas, the Earl of Derby.
On his sister’s behalf, her brother cut a deal with the Earl, offering him the money he sorely needed to repair his failing estates—but unbeknownst to Lavender’s brother, the Earl of Derby was no gentleman.
He was a hermit and a brute—determined to stay far away from a society that he felt had alienated his servant-borne mother.
It is only through a desire to save his estate that the Earl of Derby even considered Miss Latrice, expecting to find nothing more than a vapid socialite obsessed with her reputation.But what Lord of Derby did not expect to find was a growing affection, one that might, if he were unlucky, even result in love.*If you like powerful Dukes, loving Duchesses, and a marvelous depiction of the majestic Regency and Victorian era, then ''A Convincing Arrangement with a Brute'' suits you.

96,96,9344810385692,A Life in the Shadows: A Memoir,"No Indian spymaster has, until now, written a memoir. A.S. Dulat is the first to do so, and in A Life in the Shadows he does it with considerable elan.
He is one of India's most successful spymasters, his name synonymous with the Kashmir issue. His methods of engagement and accommodation with all people and perspectives from India's most conflicted state are legendary. The author of two bestselling books, Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years (2014) and The Spy Chronicles: R&amp;AW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace (2018), Dulat's views on India, Pakistan and Kashmir are well-known and sought after.
Yet very little is known about him, primarily because the former spymaster has been notoriously private about his personal life. In this unusual and unique memoir, Dulat breaks that silence for the first time. This is not a traditional, linear narrative as much as a selection of stories from across space and time. Still bound by the rules of secrecy of his trade, he tells a fascinating story of a life richly lived and insightfully observed. From a Partition-bloodied childhood in Lahore and New Delhi to his early years as a young intelligence officer; from meetings with international spymasters to travels around the world; from his observations on Kashmir-political and personal-post the abrogation of Article 370, to his encounters with world leaders, politicians and celebrities; moving from Bhopal to Nepal and from Kashmir to China, Dulat tells the story of his life with remarkable honesty, verve and wit.",Amarjit Singh Dulat,Books › Higher Education Textbooks › Social Sciences,456.69,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41iUdP0aG3L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715059906,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/a-life-in-the-shadows-a-memoir

Here we meet not just Mantel the Cromwell-catcher, but Mantel the quill-sharp critic of contemporary life' The Times, Book of the YearTHE MAGNIFICENT FINAL BOOK FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE WOLF HALL TRILOGYAs well as her celebrated career as a novelist, Hilary Mantel long contributed to newspapers and journals, unspooling stories from her own life and illuminating the world as she found it. This strand of her writing was an integral part of how she thought of herself. 'Ink is a generative fluid,' she explains. 'If you don't mean your words to breed consequences, don't write at all.' A Memoir of My Former Self collects the finest of this writing over four decades. Mantel's subjects are wide-ranging. She discusses nationalism and her own sense of belonging; our dream life flopping into our conscious life; the mythic legacy of Princess Diana; the many themes that feed into her novels - revolutionary France, psychics, Tudor England - and other novelists, from Jane Austen to V. S. Naipaul.
