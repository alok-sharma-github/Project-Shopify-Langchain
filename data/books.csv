8,9343542755612,"100 Novels That Changed the World: An inspiring journey through history’s most important literature, the perfect gift for book lovers and academics","A look at 100 inspiring novels that have left a significant mark on the world of literature and popular culture.
Before the novel, the world of books was dominated by scientific tomes, religious tracts and histories of the victorious in war. There had been stories and epic poems from ancient times – Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey recounted ancient Greece, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight was a chivalric romance in Middle English, but it was not until the seventeenth century, when the European middle classes had money and leisure, that anything so frivolous as a novel could be sold for entertainment.
Colin Salter traces the evolution of the novel from the earliest examples through to the postmodernist best-sellers of the 21st century. Rather than dwelling too long on the technical nuances of innovative writing style he has amassed 100 of the greatest novel writers and chosen their most significant work.
For writers such as Herman Melville, James Joyce or Harper Lee the decision is not a difficult one. For Charles Dickens, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, the choice is perhaps more difficult.
Following the style set with previous books in the 100 series, most notably 100 Children’s Books and 100 Science Discoveries, each author is given a concise biography and their major novel analysed and then set in context with their other published work.
Readers can become ridiculously well-read in 224 pages.

40,9344866418972,1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed: Revised and Updated (Turning Points in Ancient History Book 1),"A bold reassessment of what caused the Late Bronze Age collapseIn 1177 B.C., marauding groups known only as the ""Sea Peoples"" invaded Egypt. The pharaoh's army and navy managed to defeat them, but the victory so weakened Egypt that it soon slid into decline, as did most of the surrounding civilizations. After centuries of brilliance, the civilized world of the Bronze Age came to an abrupt and cataclysmic end. Kingdoms fell like dominoes over the course of just a few decades. No more Minoans or Mycenaeans. No more Trojans, Hittites, or Babylonians. The thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C., which had stretched from Greece to Egypt and Mesopotamia, suddenly ceased to exist, along with writing systems, technology, and monumental architecture. But the Sea Peoples alone could not have caused such widespread breakdown. How did it happen?In this major new account of the causes of this ""First Dark Ages,"" Eric Cline tells the gripping story of how the end was brought about by multiple interconnected failures, ranging from invasion and revolt to earthquakes, drought, and the cutting of international trade routes. Bringing to life the vibrant multicultural world of these great civilizations, he draws a sweeping panorama of the empires and globalized peoples of the Late Bronze Age and shows that it was their very interdependence that hastened their dramatic collapse and ushered in a dark age that lasted centuries.A compelling combination of narrative and the latest scholarship, 1177 B.C. sheds new light on the complex ties that gave rise to, and ultimately destroyed, the flourishing civilizations of the Late Bronze Age—and that set the stage for the emergence of classical Greece.",Eric H.

44,9344829292828,17 MINUTI: L'Eternità non ha più fretta (Italian Edition),"17 minuti per attraversare una piccola città della provincia siciliana. 17 minuti per dare un calcio a un tempo che sembra non passare mai e che ci opprime con la sua immobilità. 17 minuti per dire addio a chi si ama. 
Un testo teatrale che mette in primo piano una classe di ragazzi. I loro sogni a metà strada fra l'entusiasmo adolescenziale e il disincanto verso un futuro che sembra non avere speranze da offrire. Il vuoto di valori rappresentato da un professore immaturo e vanesio e dai silenzi di adulti che hanno dimenticato il proprio ruolo nella società. Nessuna educazione, nessun esempio, nessun maestro per la nuova Europa. La scuola della vita si fa sul campo e la velocità è ormai l'ultimo dio. Correre, correre, correre sempre più veloce per non restare indietro. Andare avanti e non voltarsi è l'imperativo. Correre per inerzia senza chiedersi se c'è un traguardo è la scelta obbligata. E per chi si rifiuta di cedere al nuovo diktat dell'Era contemporanea non resta che la derisione del Mondo. 17 minuti basteranno per comprendere quale sia il senso della corsa? Chissà. Sicuramente serviranno a svelare che l'Eternità non ha più fretta.

74,9343327928604,A Convincing Arrangement with a Brute: A Historical Regency Romance Book (Deals of Marriage 4),"He lived alone, far from a world that had treated his mother, born a servant, with disdain. Silent. Gruff. Always ready to expect the worst, especially at gatherings. He rarely bothers to explain himself, with a touch of bitterness in every step.
Since her father had been turned away from a ball and humiliated in her childhood, Miss Lavender Latrice had been consumed with one thing and one thing—becoming a part of the nobility that had scorned them.
But while wealth could buy some things, a title surely wasn’t one of them.
Or at least that’s what Lavender believed until her brother stumbled upon a near-penniless bare-knuckle boxer—one Austin Thomas, the Earl of Derby.
On his sister’s behalf, her brother cut a deal with the Earl, offering him the money he sorely needed to repair his failing estates—but unbeknownst to Lavender’s brother, the Earl of Derby was no gentleman.
He was a hermit and a brute—determined to stay far away from a society that he felt had alienated his servant-borne mother.
It is only through a desire to save his estate that the Earl of Derby even considered Miss Latrice, expecting to find nothing more than a vapid socialite obsessed with her reputation.But what Lord of Derby did not expect to find was a growing affection, one that might, if he were unlucky, even result in love.*If you like powerful Dukes, loving Duchesses, and a marvelous depiction of the majestic Regency and Victorian era, then ''A Convincing Arrangement with a Brute'' suits you.

96,9344810385692,A Life in the Shadows: A Memoir,"No Indian spymaster has, until now, written a memoir. A.S. Dulat is the first to do so, and in A Life in the Shadows he does it with considerable elan.
He is one of India's most successful spymasters, his name synonymous with the Kashmir issue. His methods of engagement and accommodation with all people and perspectives from India's most conflicted state are legendary. The author of two bestselling books, Kashmir: The Vajpayee Years (2014) and The Spy Chronicles: R&amp;AW, ISI and the Illusion of Peace (2018), Dulat's views on India, Pakistan and Kashmir are well-known and sought after.
Yet very little is known about him, primarily because the former spymaster has been notoriously private about his personal life. In this unusual and unique memoir, Dulat breaks that silence for the first time. This is not a traditional, linear narrative as much as a selection of stories from across space and time. Still bound by the rules of secrecy of his trade, he tells a fascinating story of a life richly lived and insightfully observed. From a Partition-bloodied childhood in Lahore and New Delhi to his early years as a young intelligence officer; from meetings with international spymasters to travels around the world; from his observations on Kashmir-political and personal-post the abrogation of Article 370, to his encounters with world leaders, politicians and celebrities; moving from Bhopal to Nepal and from Kashmir to China, Dulat tells the story of his life with remarkable honesty, verve and wit.",Amarjit Singh Dulat,Books › Higher Education Textbooks › Social Sciences,456.69,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41iUdP0aG3L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715059906,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/a-life-in-the-shadows-a-memoir

Here we meet not just Mantel the Cromwell-catcher, but Mantel the quill-sharp critic of contemporary life' The Times, Book of the YearTHE MAGNIFICENT FINAL BOOK FROM THE BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE WOLF HALL TRILOGYAs well as her celebrated career as a novelist, Hilary Mantel long contributed to newspapers and journals, unspooling stories from her own life and illuminating the world as she found it. This strand of her writing was an integral part of how she thought of herself. 'Ink is a generative fluid,' she explains. 'If you don't mean your words to breed consequences, don't write at all.' A Memoir of My Former Self collects the finest of this writing over four decades. Mantel's subjects are wide-ranging. She discusses nationalism and her own sense of belonging; our dream life flopping into our conscious life; the mythic legacy of Princess Diana; the many themes that feed into her novels - revolutionary France, psychics, Tudor England - and other novelists, from Jane Austen to V. S. Naipaul. She writes about her father and the man who replaced him; she writes fiercely and heartbreakingly about the battles with her health she endured as a young woman, and the stifling years she found herself living in Saudi Arabia.

161,9344846168348,Airline Maps: A Century of Art and Design,"In this gorgeously illustrated collection of airline route maps, mark ovenden and Maxwell Roberts look to the skies and transport readers to another time. Hundreds of images span a century of passenger flight, from the rudimentary trajectory of routes to the most intricately detailed birds-eye views of the land to be flown over. Advertisements for the first Scheduled commercial passenger flights featured only a few destinations, with stunning views of the countryside and graphics of biplanes. As aviation took off, speed and mileage were trumpeted on bold posters featuring busy routes. Major airlines produced highly stylized illustrations of their global presence, establishing now-classic brands. With trendy and forward-looking designs, cartographers celebrated the coming together of different cultures and made the Earth look ever smaller. Eventually, fleets got bigger and routes multiplied, and graphic designers have found creative new ways to display huge amounts of information. Airline hubs bring their own cultural mark and advertise their plentiful destination options. Innovative maps depict our busy world with webs of overlapping routes and networks of low-cost city-to-city hopping. But though flying has become more commonplace, ovenden and Roberts remind us that early air travel was a glamorous affair for good reason. Airline maps is a celebration of graphic design, cartographic skills and clever marketing, and a visual feast that reminds us to enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",Mark Ovenden and Maxwell Roberts,"Books › Arts, Film & Photography › Design & Fashion",759.69,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/515rP95T5qL._SX342_SY445.jpg?v=1715061779,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/airline-maps-a-century-of-art-and-design

164,9344850362652,Aladdin's Lamp: How Greek Science Came to Europe Through the Islamic World,"Aladdin’s Lamp is the fascinating story of how ancient Greek philosophy and science began in the sixth century B.C. and, during the next millennium, spread across the Greco-Roman world, producing the remarkable discoveries and theories of Thales, Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes, Galen, Ptolemy, and many others. John Freely explains how, as the Dark Ages shrouded Europe, scholars in medieval Baghdad translated the works of these Greek thinkers into Arabic, spreading their ideas throughout the Islamic world from Central Asia to Spain, with many Muslim scientists, most notably Avicenna, Alhazen, and Averroës, adding their own interpretations to the philosophy and science they had inherited. Freely goes on to show how, beginning in the twelfth century, these texts by Islamic scholars were then translated from Arabic into Latin, sparking the emergence of modern science at the dawn of the Renaissance, which climaxed in the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century.",John Freely,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,526.69,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51gGSyDhy2L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062029,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/aladdins-lamp-how-greek-science-came-to-europe-through-the-islamic-world

What if you were the spark that could ignite a revolution?
For years Laia has lived in fear. Fear of the Empire, fear of the Martials, fear of truly living at all. Born as a Scholar, she’s never had much of a choice.
For Elias it’s the opposite. He has seen too much on his path to becoming a Mask, one of the Empire’s elite soldiers. With the Masks’ help the Empire has conquered a continent and enslaved thousands of Scholars, all in the name of power.
When Laia’s brother is taken she must force herself to help the Resistance, the only people who have a chance of saving him. She must spy on the Commandant, ruthless overseer of Blackcliff Academy. Blackcliff is the training ground for Masks and the very place that Elias is planning to escape. If he succeeds, he will be named deserter. If found, the punishment will be death.
But once Laia and Elias meet, they find that their destinies are intertwined and that their choices will change the fate of the Empire.

199,9344860356892,Anatomy of a Breakthrough: How to get unstuck and unlock your potential,"Anatomy of a Breakthrough is a groundbreaking guide to optimising your life, overcoming obstacles, and reaching your full potential. All of us go through episodes of simply being stuck, whether we're trapped in a thankless job, wrestling writer's block, muddling through a midlife crisis, or trying to remedy a fraying friendship. The resulting emotion is a mix of anxiety, uncertainty, fear, anger, and numbness, and it's often chronic, dangerous to our mental health, and with severe consequences to our success and development. What if someone told you that there is a proven plan to break through and to get unstuck? Anatomy of a Breakthrough is the remedy to identifying and overcoming the friction points holding us back. Professor of Marketing and bestselling author Adam Alter offers a brilliant new framework for not only getting unstuck but also going on to flourish. Critically, he introduces us to the Friction Audit - a test to work out where our sticking points lie between our HEAD, HEART or HABITS - and then takes us on a roadmap to break through. Alter illustrates his formula by sharing the stories of great 'unstickers' among us: the sub-elite swimmer who unstuck himself twice to win two Olympic gold medals; the actor who faced countless rejections before gaining worldwide fame; the renowned painter who became paralyzed and had to relearn to paint with a brush strapped to his wrist; as well as Alter's own story of breaking away from a college degree that made him deeply unhappy.

200,9343414894876,Anatomy Of Genres: How Story Forms Explain the Way the World Works,"A guide to understanding the major genres of the story world by the legendary writing teacher and author of The Anatomy of Story, John Truby.Most people think genres are simply categories on Netflix or Amazon that provide a helpful guide to making entertainment choices. Most people are wrong. Genre stories aren’t just a small subset of the films, video games, TV shows, and books that people consume. They are the all-stars of the entertainment world, comprising the vast majority of popular stories worldwide. That’s why businesses―movie studios, production companies, video game studios, and publishing houses―buy and sell them. Writers who want to succeed professionally must write the stories these businesses want to buy. Simply put, the storytelling game is won by mastering the structure of genres.The Anatomy of Genres: How Story Forms Explain the Way the World Works is the legendary writing teacher John Truby’s step-by-step guide to understanding and using the basic building blocks of the story world. He details the three ironclad rules of successful genre writing, and analyzes more than a dozen major genres and the essential plot events, or “beats,” that define each of them. As he shows, the ability to combine these beats in the right way is what separates stories that sell from those that don’t. Truby also reveals how a single story can combine elements of different genres, and how the best writers use this technique to craft unforgettable stories that stand out from the crowd. Just as Truby’s first book, The Anatomy of Story, changed the way writers develop stories, The Anatomy of Genres will enhance their quality and expand the impact they have on the world.",John Truby,"Books › Arts, Film & Photography › Cinema & Broadcast",593.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/417sZDStKrL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994692,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/anatomy-of-genres-how-story-forms-explain-the-way-the-world-works

Itinerary
How to plan a trip to Andaman Islands and what highlights not to miss? 

Transport 
Getting there and around Andaman Islands. Ships, buses, jeep, tuk-tuks (auto rickshaws) and helicopters.

Accommodation 
Your sleeping options range from bamboo huts with a mattress on the floor to luxury rooms and cottages. Prices start from 6-7 € per night for bamboo hut to over 100 € per night for luxury rooms. Read more and avoid overpriced tourist traps on Havelock and Neil islands.

Port Blair 
Focused on info real individual traveler’s needs. Many people just pass thru on the way to Havelock. However, Port Blair does have one spectacular sight, worth budgeting an extra day. And it is not the jail. What is it?

Havelock
Is Havelock heaven or hell of the archipelago? Both! This guide, is probably the only place, where you can read about negative things. We do not need to sell any tours or services to you, so we can afford to be always open, straightforward and if needed be, critical. Read on, we will advise you how to minimize hell and maximize paradise :)

Neil Island
Visitors mostly tend to think of Neil island as being more quiet alternative to Havelock. Having visited 13 Andaman islands, we have difficulties to agree with that.

North Andaman
The real beauty and the best area of the whole Andaman and Nicobar archipelago, is in the north. Still, not many people make their way this far. Good for you! When you take this little extra effort, you can enjoy the area with little to no tourist in sight.

Little Andaman,
has that sensational feel of the end of the world. Kilometers of beaches, jungle waterfalls and water reservoirs wait just for you. Enjoy a motorbike ride and feel the complete freedom to discover the beauty of this island. And it is surprisingly inexpensive!

Middle Andaman
Island's highlights are its turtle nesting beaches and two mangrove walkways. Check transport and accommodation at Middle Andaman and explore its exotically named places: Dhani Nallah, Moricedera and Yeratta ...

Long Island
Beautiful Lalaji Bay beach and nice jungle walk heading from the inhabited south of the island to the Lalaji bay.

Wandoor and MG Marine national park
Wonderful sea journey thru narrow stretch of the sea, surrounded by dense jungle on both sides. And then the Indian bureaucracy ruins your paradise.

245,9343389401372,As Good as My Word: A Memoir,"'On 19 May 2007, I was summoned to the Prime Minister's house ... He thought I would be right for the job.'
In an illustrious career spanning over forty years in public service and culminating in the highest office in Indian bureaucracy - Union Cabinet Secretary - K.M. Chandrasekhar has seen, and done, it all. He is one of those rare IAS officers who has held a wide range of senior positions in State government, the Centre, and public sector undertakings.
In this autobiography, he paints an intimate picture of the UPA government during one of its toughest phases and his own, crucial, role in steering India through some of her most severe crises - the Great Recession of 2008, the oilmen's strike in 2009 and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks - and scams - the 2G Spectrum case and the 2010 Commonwealth Games corruption scandal. This book describes Chandrasekhar's experiments in public administration, cutting his teeth in trade diplomacy as the Indian ambassador to the World Trade Organization, his excellent working equation with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his run-ins with some prominent ministers of the time, and his reflections on Indian democracy, economy and defence.
As Good as My Word is the story of the successes and failures of a civil servant, who successfully navigated challenging areas of public life. Unsparingly honest and forthright, and packed with political gossip, the book offers a ringside view of Indian politics and bureaucracy during the UPA era.",K.M.

But his life as emperor was not always led by non-violence.

296,9344873496860,Best of Faraz,"Ahmed Faraz is considered one of the greatest modern Urdu poets of the last century. Essentially a romantic poet, steeped in classical Persian and Urdu traditions, he combined the sensitivity and lyricism of the great Urdu poet Meer Taqi Meer and the philosophical range and depth of Mirza Ghalib, his poetry also reflected a progressive outlook. He is often compared to Faiz Ahmed Faiz for his simple style of writing because of which he became popular among common readers and connoisseurs of urdu poetry. Born on January 14, 1931 in Kohat (Pakistan) in a Pushto-speaking family, Faraz, started his career as a script writer for Radio Pakistan. Later he went into academics and also served as the director-general of the Pakistan Academy of Letters. Because of the long spells of dictatorship in Pakistan, Faraz often resorted to symbolism in his poetry to deliberately create an ambiguity so that his lines could be interpreted differently by different people, and mirrored a new kind of ""political sensibility."" Though Faraz wrote in Urdu, he did not hesitate from using Hindi words if they served his poetic purpose for he believed, ""Hindi is close to Urdu, besides it enriches the language."" Despite being known as a progressive poet, Faraz's most famous ghazal is a romantic one, ""Ranjish hi sahi dil hii dukhaane ke liye aa."" He died from kidney failure in Islamabad on 25 August, 2008. This book offers a selection of the best ghazals of Ahmed Faraz, translated into English by Kuldeep Salil.

The original store opened in 1921 and became known as the haunt of literary greats, such as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, George Bernard Shaw, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein and James Joyce.Sadly the shop was forced to close in 1941, but that was not the end of 'Shakespeare and Company'... In 1951 another bookshop, with a similar free-thinking ethos, opened on the Left Bank. Called 'Le Mistral', it had beds for those of a literary mindset who found themselves down on their luck and, in 1964, it resurrected the name 'Shakespeare and Company' and became the principal meeting place for Beatnik poets, such as Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, through to Henry Miller and Lawrence Durrell.Today the tradition continues and writers still find their way to this bizarre establishment, one of them being Jeremy Mercer. With no friends, no job, no money and no prospects, the thrill of escape from his life in Canada soon palls but, by chance, he happens upon the fairytale world of 'Shakespeare and Co' and is taken in.What follows is his tale of his time there, the curious people who came and went, the realities of being down and out in the 'city of light' and, in particular, his relationship with the beguiling octogenarian owner, George.",Jeremy Mercer,Books › Travel & Tourism › Specialty Travel,445.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41Rphd8fdQL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715059916,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/books-baguettes-and-bedbugs-enchanting-memoir-of-a-struggling-writer-and-an-eccentric-paris-bookshop

357,9344873005340,Breath of a Wandering City Leaf,"This anthology consists of 70 poems taking deep inspiration from nature and personifying it to express subtle emotions and moments from daily life. The poetry presented deals with everyday happenings around us. The poet finds comfort in seeking hope and believing in a purpose for life. Though finding a purpose is itself a lucky chance, once a soul finds it, then for the poet comes the real brunt of daily consistent hard work. It's this hard work which makes an individual humble and often finds oneself on a less crowded path. This journey, which is not easy, makes us very sensitive to the struggles of others and develops a sense of empathy. It also helps bond with others who are on such journeys. Kartikey’s poems find such a connection deeply with nature which is consistent on this journey of change. The soul of nature has a purpose and is honest. Kartikey’s poems try to find a bond with these kinds of souls.

The case has captured the nation’s imagination but Kajii refuses to speak with the press, entertaining no visitors. That is, until journalist Rika Machida writes a letter asking for her recipe for beef stew and Kajii can’t resist writing back.
Rika, the only woman in her news office, works late each night, rarely cooking more than ramen. As the visits unfold between her and the steely Kajii, they are closer to a masterclass in food than journalistic research. Rika hopes this gastronomic exchange will help her soften Kajii but it seems that she might be the one changing. With each meal she eats, something is awakening in her body, might she and Kaji have more in common than she once thought?
Inspired by the real case of the convicted con woman and serial killer, ""The Konkatsu Killer"", Asako Yuzuki’s Butter is a vivid, unsettling exploration of misogyny, obsession, romance and the transgressive pleasures of food in Japan.

The book should stimulate interest in a variety of trips in our extended neighbourhood, and in the South generally, where travelling is not only more affordable, but in countless ways more interesting. The author takes us through his adventures and brushes with history, whether the building of the Berlin Wall, wandering into Somaliland, running smack into a civil war in Cyprus, taking a front seat in the People Power revolution in the Philippines, getting arrested during the Dirty War while trying to track down a group of Sikh settlers in a remote part of Argentina, catching a cargo boat down the Mekong from China, or riding a paddle steamer up the Nile for ten days in what is today South Sudan. By Thumb, Hoof and Wheel is entertaining, educative, and completely from a different world – a world that is rapidly changing with the forces of global homogenization.

Unearthing previously unseen papers and interviewing countless insiders, Roger Faligot's astonishing account reveals nothing less than a century of world events shaped by Chinese spies. Working as scientists, journalists, diplomats, foreign students and businessmen, they have been everywhere, from Stalin's purges to 9/11. This murky world has swept up Ho Chi Minh, the Clintons and everyone in between, with the action moving from Cambodia to Cambridge, and from the Australian outback to the centres of Western power.
In the twenty-first century, the Chinese intelligence services, an umbrella term that includes several organisations, rival the largest in the world: the American CIA, the Israeli Mossad, the Indian R&amp;AW, the French DGSE, Britain's MI6, and of course the other intelligence services in the region, such as the Taiwanese MJIB and the Japanese Naicho.

In spite of living in the same apartment block in Paris, Neera, Rosel, Violet and Dasha have no idea about each other’s existence. In the grand duplex of Number Thirty-Six, the socialite Neera chain-smokes spliffs and lives a life of luxury with her director-producer husband. Many floors above, Rosel, a Filipina housekeeper-cum-nanny, dreams in her tiny attic room of becoming a French citizen and being reunited with her son. Seventeen-year-old Russian model, Dasha, shares her cramped apartment with other women, wanting to walk the ramp for the biggest fashion moguls but settling for whoever pays the bills. And on the ground floor, Violet, a Senegalese trans woman, is a burlesque dancer at night and plays savior to a handsome beggar by day. When the whole world comes to a halt and turns itself upside down, the women of Number Thirty-Six are shocked out of their arduous lives. They become the unlikeliest of friends, relying on each other to belong to this city that is insistent on alienating them.

‘A tender, devastating and funny exploration of love and friendship and the yearning for self-evisceration. Coco Mellors is an elegant and exciting new voice’ PANDORA SYKES, author of How Do We Know We’re Doing It Right
New York is slipping from Cleo’s grasp. Sure, she’s at a different party every other night, but she barely knows anyone. Her student visa is running out, and she doesn’t even have money for cigarettes. But then she meets Frank. Twenty years older, Frank's life is full of all the success and excess that Cleo's lacks. He offers her the chance to be happy, the freedom to paint, and the opportunity to apply for a green card. She offers him a life imbued with beauty and art―and, hopefully, a reason to cut back on his drinking. He is everything she needs right now.
Cleo and Frank run head-first into a romance that neither of them can quite keep up with. It reshapes their lives and the lives of those around them, whether that’s Cleo's best friend struggling to embrace his gender identity in the wake of her marriage, or Frank's financially dependent sister arranging sugar daddy dates after being cut off. Ultimately, this chance meeting between two strangers outside of a New Year’s Eve party changes everything, for better or worse.

The book is journey through 5000 years of evolution of Hinduism, and is outcome of seven years of study to understand the roots of Hinduism. Tracing the genesis of Hinduism to pre-Indus Valley period, the book explains Hindu, Hinduism and Sanatana Dharma, before it takes one through Hinduism's oldest scriptures - the four Vedas, the four components of each Veda, and what they contain. How all original translations of Vedic texts were done by Western Sanskrit scholars, and why their works have left scope for doubt about the fidelity of translations.
About the Book : Knowledge in the Vedas
The book explores the relation between the Divine Reality and the ritualistic worship practised by Hindus. The first chapter describes interpretations of the symbols used by Rishis in Rig Vedic hymns and of important slokas of Isha Upanishad and also describes the Vedic and Sankhyaic Paradigms, which are frameworks for the knowledge embodying Creation. In the following three chapters, discussions of the origins of the Vedas and the evolution of Vedic auxiliary texts are provided. In most Hindu households, worshippers seldom discuss the spiritual significance of mantras and sthothrams making it appear that the Gods they worship are different from reality.

The only way to be what you want, do what you want, have what you want is to change—change your mindset, your attitude, your actions. If only change was that easy... Commit to Yourself makes embracing change a cakewalk, not a tightrope one. It offers no dense philosophy, no gyaan. It lays out simple but time-tested ways based on pioneering studies in behavioural science and the author’s many years of experience in mentoring thousands of people from all walks of life to change yourself first because all changes—personal or professional— you desire to bring in your life depend on it.The author explains why your current approach of handling things does not work, makes you understand and overcome your biases and thus create the much-needed mental shift to get you out of your comfort zone. Committing to yourself is not a selfish act, it takes courage. The author helps you take the first step in that direction by breaking free from what no longer serves you—toxic relationships, and self-destructive thinking and habits. She shows you how to live by your core values; discusses strategies to beat odds, handle regrets and failures; build your muscle of courage and find your authentic self.

447,9343541412124,Contemporary English Literature,"The book expresses contemporary consciousness in different genres of English literature from multi-functional perspective. The nowhere man brings to the fore the relationship of the orients and the occidents and exposes the problem of transculturation with its diasporic concerns. The inheritance of loss in its multi-textured form reflects the experiences of an illegal immigrant. Jhumpa Lahiri in her works appears as an articulate commentator of the maladies of women immigrants. For them, settlement in the new social environment in a foreign country with all its comforts and glamours proves to be a poor substitute for the loss of native moorings. The impressionist thematises the idea that identity as a concept cannot be basic and invariable. The world according to hsu refers to the identity reformulations in this age of diasporas and advocates that one’s biological identity may not be the only identity because erosion and accretions are bound to come with the Act of emigration. Imtiaz dharker with her various cultural experiences of Pakistan, India and Britain takes a pluralistic approach in her poems in presenting an image of a disintegrating world. Contemporary theories like postmodernism, which are allied to present literature, contribute to better understanding of our present social and psychic conditions.

The Courage to be Disliked shows you how to unlock the power within yourself to become your best and truest self, change your future and find lasting happiness.

454,9344858751260,"Cox: Or, the Course of Time (The Seagull Library of German Literature)","Richly imagined and recounted in vivid prose of extraordinary beauty, this book is a stunning illustration of Ransmayr’s talent for imbuing a captivating tale with intense metaphorical, indeed metaphysical force. The world’s most powerful man, Qiánlóng, emperor of China, invites the famous eighteenth-century clockmaker Alister Cox to his court in Beijing. There, in the heart of the Forbidden City, the Englishman and his assistants are to build machines that mark the passing of time as a child or a condemned man might experience it and that capture the many shades of happiness, suffering, love, and loss that come with that passing. Mystified by the rituals of a rigidly hierarchical society dominated by an unimaginably wealthy, god-like ruler, Cox musters all his expertise and ingenuity to satisfy the emperor’s desires. Finally, Qiánlóng, also known by the moniker Lord of Time, requests the construction of a clock capable of measuring eternity―a perpetuum mobile. Seizing this chance to realize a long-held dream and honor the memory of his late beloved daughter, yet conscious of the impossibility of his task, Cox sets to work. As the court is suspended in a never-ending summer, festering with evil gossip about the monster these foreigners are creating, the Englishmen wonder if they will ever escape from their gilded cage. More than a meeting of two men, one isolated by power, the other by grief, this is an exploration of mortality and a virtuoso demonstration that storytelling alone can truly conquer time.",Christoph Ransmayr,Books › History › Region & Countries,399.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41o_QEze-EL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062449,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/cox-or-the-course-of-time-the-seagull-library-of-german-literature

456,9343539872028,Creative Destruction: Why Companies That Are Built to Last Underperform the Market--And How to Successfully Transform Them,"Turning conventional wisdom on its head, a Senior Partner and an Innovation Specialist from McKinsey &amp; Company debunk the myth that high-octane, built-to-last companies can continue to excel year after year and reveal the dynamic strategies of discontinuity and creative destruction these corporations must adopt in order to maintain excellence and remain competitive.In striking contrast to such bibles of business literature as In Search of Excellence and Built to Last, Richard N. Foster and Sarah Kaplan draw on research they conducted at McKinsey &amp; Company of more than one thousand corporations in fifteen industries over a thirty-six-year period. The industries they examined included old-economy industries such as pulp and paper and chemicals, and new-economy industries like semiconductors and software. Using this enormous fact base, Foster and Kaplan show that even the best-run and most widely admired companies included in their sample are unable to sustain their market-beating levels of performance for more than ten to fifteen years. Foster and Kaplan's long-term studies of corporate birth, survival, and death in America show that the corporate equivalent of El Dorado, the golden company that continually outperforms the market, has never existed. It is a myth.Corporations operate with management philosophies based on the assumption of continuity; as a result, in the long term, they cannot change or create value at the pace and scale of the markets. Their control processes, the very processes that enable them to survive over the long haul, deaden them to the vital and constant need for change. Proposing a radical new business paradigm, Foster and Kaplan argue that redesigning the corporation to change at the pace and scale of the capital markets rather than merely operate well will require more than simple adjustments. They explain how companies like Johnson and Johnson , Enron, Corning, and GE are overcoming cultural ""lock-in"" by transforming rather than incrementally improving their companies. They are doing this by creating new businesses, selling off or closing down businesses or divisions whose growth is slowing down, as well as abandoning outdated, ingrown structures and rules and adopting new decision-making processes, control systems, and mental models. Corporations, they argue, must learn to be as dynamic and responsive as the market itself if they are to sustain superior returns and thrive over the long term.In a book that is sure to shake the business world to its foundations, Creative Destruction, like Re-Engineering the Corporation before it, offers a new paradigm that will change the way we think about business.",Richard Foster,Books › Business & Economics › Economics,974.69,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41No5yhuScL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714995261,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/creative-destruction-why-companies-that-are-built-to-last-underperform-the-market-and-how-to-successfully-transform-them

'An unsparing yet profoundly beautiful novel' Chigozie Obioma
A woman in post-apartheid South Africa confronts her family’s troubling past in this taut and daring novel about national trauma and collective guilt.
Cape Town, 2028. The land cracks from a years-long drought, the nearby mountains threaten to burn, and the queue for the water trucks grows ever longer.
In her crumbling corner of a public housing complex, Deidre van Deventer receives a call from the South African police. Her family home, recently reclaimed by the government, has become the scene of a criminal investigation. The remains of several bodies have just been unearthed from her land, after decades underground. Detectives pepper Deidre with questions: Was your brother a member of a pro-apartheid group in the 1990s? Is it true that he was building bombs as part of a terrorist plot?
Deidre doesn’t know the answers to the detectives’ questions. All she knows is that she was denied―repeatedly―the life she felt she deserved. Overshadowed by her brother, then left behind by her daughter after she emigrated, Deidre must watch over her ageing mother and make do with government help and the fading generosity of her neighbours while the landscape around her grows more and more combustible. As alarming evidence from the investigation continues to surface, and detectives pressure her to share what she knows of her family’s disturbing past, Deidre must finally face her own shattered memories so that something better might emerge for her and her country.
In exquisitely spare prose, Karen Jennings weaves a singularly powerful novel about post-apartheid South Africa. It is an unforgettable, propulsive story of fractured families, collective guilt, the ways we become trapped in prisons of our own making, and how we can begin to break free.",Karen Jennings,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,379.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41gZm8I5XVL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714995432,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/crooked-seeds
470,9343279366428,Crypto Crimes: Inside India's Best-Kept Secret,"The size of crypto investments in India stands at more than $10 billion, and about 15 million Indians have invested in cryptocurrencies. Most crypto traders are in the age group of twenty-two to thirty years, and hail from Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 towns. The volatility and easy money that crypto promises has turned it into a financial phenomenon. As the traders know, mining crypto coins is an arms race that rewards early adopters. And they are in a hurry.
So where and when did the chase for fast money begin to take so many wrong turns?
This book traces the murky underbelly of the crypto world and its mercurial spread across India-from the interiors of Uttar Pradesh, where crypto accounts are looted at gunpoint to quick black to white, switches for money in Bihar to the lure of drugs and parties in Karnataka and social media influencers who choose to be paid in crypto to circumvent both taxes and accountability.
Crimes range in both scale and concentration. In a chilling report, a Special Investigation Team reported that cryptocurrency is allegedly being used for transactions in narcotics, drugs, smuggling, investment of unaccounted money and illegal betting. Its latest use is to procure arms and weapons, becoming an easy conduit to fund terror activities against the Indian state. And this is only the tip of the iceberg.
With personal stories and first-person accounts, Crypto Crimes goes deep into the dark web to reveal the truth behind the crypto bubble that is red-hot, unregulated and spells trouble.",Mitali Mukherjee,"Books › Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts › True Accounts",381.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51ptNZ7qG7L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994095,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/crypto-crimes-inside-indias-best-kept-secret

Reeling from a brutal attack that leaves her best friend dead and her badly injured, Lisa Fulbrook flees to the countryside to recuperate. With only vague memories of the event, she isolates herself from her friends and family, content to spend her days wandering the hills with her dog, Riley.
However, Lisa is soon plagued, not only by vivid flashbacks, but questions, too: how did their assailant know them? Why were they attacked? And what really happened that night?
As she desperately tries to piece together the memories, Lisa realises that there's another truth still hidden to her, a truth she can't escape from. A truth that may have been right in front of her all along.
A clever, sophisticated, psychological thriller, perfect for fans of Gillian Flynn, S.J. Watson, B A Paris and Sophie Hannah

497,9344862683420,Dawn of the Raj: The Company that Ruled India ǀ The sensational history of the East India Company,"An intrepid band of sea-faring merchants, sailors and soldiers arrive from a distant land. While they come seeking some space in the court of Jahangir, the tide turns completely a century later. They become the largest power in the subcontinent – eclipsing the other empires, creating one of the biggest empires that the world has known. But how did the English East India Company grow to become such a force? From 1600 to 1858, the life span of the Company, there occurred its dramatic metamorphosis from a small commercial group sponsored by Queen Elizabeth into a cumbersome organization that controlled enormous revenues, vast properties, armed forces, innumerable ships and countless trading posts. Starting from the first ship that touched Indian mainland in 1608, for the next hundred years, the English factory at Surat was at the centre of struggle. The Company’s initial strategic entry into the nation is a fascinating story that this book tries to chronicle. Pitched against two formidable European rivals, two hostile successive rulers at home, some of the most dreaded and the most celebrated pirates of all times, the Mughal rulers in India and the Marathas in ascendency – this is the story of the East India Company.",Ranjit Mishra,Books › History › World,541.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41KhGIqDm8L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062654,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/dawn-of-the-raj-the-company-that-ruled-india-ǀ-the-sensational-history-of-the-east-india-company

I shifted My Family to another place. At about 1.30 br.M. In the afternoon on February 24 We began pelting stones.” only those who are not familiar with the real face of the aam aadmi party will be surprised or shocked by the above statements made by the now expelled counsellor Tahir Hussain. The aam aadmi party used its network of people associated with mosques and madarsas and relied on leaders such as Tahir Husain and a man at ulla Khan to bag the Muslim votes in Delhi. In return for the votes, it seems that the party gave the licence to a specific community to consign North East Delhi to flames. Now that the chargesheet has been finalised by the Delhi Police about the riots that took place in East Delhi, it will be a fallacy to disassociate the riots that took place in places such as jafrabad, maujpur, babarpur, Gokul Puri, karawal Nagar, bhajanpura, Yamuna Vihar from the violence that took place during the anti-caa protests. The violence that occurred during the anti-caa protests in places such as br shaheen Bagh, Jamia Nagar, seelampur were actually the precursor to a big riot. The riot that took place in the north-east parts of Delhi during us President Donald Trump's visit from February 23-26, 2020. For the violence that was orchestrated during these riots, the work of collecting empty bottles, stones and storing these on rooftops of houses had begun on February 4. Many people of the Muslim community had filled Petrol in their vehicles so that this fuel could later be used for making Petrol bombs. In many Muslim families, pamphlets about such riots were distributed with instructions on how to deal with Hindus. It is not Rocket Science to understand that the Muslim community was already prepared for the riots that broke out in north-east Delhi. Hindus did not get a chance to get their Act together.

553,9343404540188,Dr Bhimrao Amedkar | A Complete Biography | The Messiah of Dalits and Architect of Indian Constitution | India's Bharat Ratna Awardee Untouchable Rights Advocate | Social Justice Equality,"Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar is considered the Messiah of the Dalits in India. In 1947, the Constituent Assembly appointed him as the chairman of the Drafting Committee constituted for drafting the Constitution for independent India. He played a key role in building the Constitution.
He was born on 14 April 1891 at Mhow (near Indore), a small town of present Madhya Pradesh. He was the fourteenth child of Subedar Ramji and Bhimabai Sakpal. Being from the Maharcaste, he was treated as an ‘untouchable’. His father and his grandfather had served in the British Army. Good schools were arranged by the then government for the education of the children of all military personnel. Therefore, despite being from a low caste, he got a good education.
In 1937, Dr Ambedkar introduced a bill to end the ‘Khoti’ practice of Mahars working as official slaves in the Konkan region. When India became independent in 1947, he adorned the post of the Minister of Law. He had made a clarion call—‘Lost rights are never regained by begging... but by relentless struggle’.
For his remarkable work, he was posthumously awarded India’s highest civilian award ‘Bharat Ratna’ in the year 1990.",Pankaj Kishore,"Books › Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts › Biographies & Autobiographies",171.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41Jh5VOc6ML._SX342_SY445.jpg?v=1714994650,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/dr-bhimrao-amedkar-a-complete-biography-the-messiah-of-dalits-and-architect-of-indian-constitution-indias-bharat-ratna-awardee-untouchable-rights-advocate-social-justice-equality

566,9344861831452,Dual Possession- The Exorcism of Ketki Katoch,"In the rich chronicle of exorcism folklore, we have all encountered stories of banishing malicious spirits from the human form. The exorcist brandishes sacred rituals, aiming to purify the plagued. But what happens when the darkness extends deeper, when one body becomes a host not to one, but to two sinister evil spirits? Dual Possession emerges as a perplexing phenomenon, challenging the very core of exorcism. Would the traditional arsenal of holy practices prove sufficient, or must the exorcist journey into realms beyond, perhaps embrace elements of witchcraft? Thus begins the saga of ""Dual Possession- Exorcism of Ketki Katoch,"" where the norms of possession went beyond the exorcist’s wisdom. In the mystical expanse of Bhandunga town lay the foreboding Katoch estate—a place steeped in shadow and haunted by a tragedy.

Does Kavita's crazy mind hold the key to unlocking the secrets of dual possession?

Illustrated by Raúl Allén and Patricia Martín, this spectacular blend of adventure and spirituality, environmentalism, and politics is a groundbreaking look into our universe and transformed by the graphic novel format into a powerful, fantastical tale for a new generation of readers.“This is a fantastic way to read the Dune epic and to become immersed in the greater details of the novel. The clear and precise artwork makes the narrative easy to follow and imbues the story with a cutting edge of the best stylish qualities that graphic novels have to offer.” —Alex RossCover illustration by Eisner Award–winning artist Bill Sienkiewicz",Brian Herbert,Books › Comics & Mangas › Comics,1821.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51dixk5YyPL._SY445_SX342_1103bcc9-597d-44fe-baee-dcf59c840446.jpg?v=1715060667,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/dune-the-graphic-novel-book-2-mu-muad-dib
571,9344863109404,Dwapar Katha: The Stories of the Mahabharata,"The Mahabharata, one of India's most cherished epics, has fascinated generations. The age-old saga of warring cousins-the valiant Pandavas and the formidable Kauravas-has left an indelible mark on our collective imagination. Yet, beneath the stories of valour and villainy lie complex human emotions that challenge our ideas about 'good' and 'evil'. Can the virtuous always conquer the malevolent? Are the Kauravas truly the embodiment of darkness, while the Pandavas exude righteousness? Does Dharma triumph in the end?
In Dwapar Katha: The Stories of the Mahabharata, Sudipta Bhawmik delves deep into the intricacies of human nature as he explores the psyches of an eclectic cast of characters, unearthing their motivations and desires. He immerses us in their ceaseless inner struggles on a battlefield more profound than Kurukshetra. Feel the seething anger of Bheem as he rages against the silent Yudhishtir during Draupadi's disrobing and grieve with Duroyadhan when he loses his dear friend Karna in the war. Explore the concepts of Dharma and Karma along with the Pandavas, as Sudipta unearths age-old tales of the Vana Parva, where rishis share life lessons with the exiled Pandavas.
Rooted in Sudipta's immensely popular podcast, which has recorded over 20 million downloads, Dwapar Katha is a delight to read. The captivating prose and stunning illustrations breathe new life into this timeless tale where darkness and light intertwine and heroes are often indistinguishable from villains. The Mahabharata has never been more enchanting, thought-provoking and alive.",Sudipta Bhawmik,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,389.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51AB706zbZL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062678,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/dwapar-katha-the-stories-of-the-mahabharata

Epic failures. An epic story.Walter Isaacson charts Elon Musk’s journey from humble beginnings to one of the wealthiest people on the planet – but is Musk a genius or a jerk?   From the author of Steve Jobs and other bestselling biographies, this is the astonishingly intimate story of Elon Musk, the most fascinating and controversial innovator of our era – a rule-breaking visionary who helped to lead the world into the era of electric vehicles, private space exploration and artificial intelligence. Oh, and took over Twitter. When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue and charismatic fantasist. His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive. At the beginning of 2022 – after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth – Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. ‘I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,’ he said. It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.For two years, Walter Isaacson had unprecedented access. He shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers and adversaries. The result is the revealing inside story, filled with amazing tales of triumphs and turmoil, that addresses the question: are the demons that drive Musk also what it takes to drive innovation and progress?

He believed then that he had seen the worst that India could do to herself. But after the violence in Gujarat in 2002, he had reason to feel that the worst, perhaps, is still to come. Analysing the communal violence in Gujarat in 2002, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, the burning of Graham Staines and his children, the targeted killings by terrorists in Punjab and Kashmir, Khushwant Singh forces us to confront the absolute corruption of religion that has made us among the most brutal people on earth. He also points out that fundamentalism has less to do with religion than with politics. And communal politics, he reminds us, is only the most visible of the demons we have nurtured and let loose upon ourselves.

It is also an analytic or interpretive literary composition. Essays, therefore, essentially reveal the personality of the writer besides giving his/her viewpoints on a specific subject matter.
Essays help us express ourselves, our thoughts, our ideas and our perceptions about things we are associated with or about things we are impacted with or wish to have an impact on. Essays not only provide the required space and tool, they also let us leisurely saunter along. Tweeting or emailing cannot achieve this. This answers why we should write essays. We should write because we cannot always speak out minds coherently.
There is no fixed length of an essay. It could be written in just about 100 words or even in several thousand words. Generally speaking, essays are not very long. But they need not be too small either.

618,9344868647196,"Ethiopia: A Photographic Tribute to East Africa's Diverse Cultures & Traditions (Art photography, Books About Africa)","A monolithic collection of images captured by photographer Joey L. over the course of thirteen years with the support of his dedicated Ethiopian crew.""Joey L.’s Ethiopia book is a true love letter to my home country of Ethiopia, the land of milk and honey. His imagery does a beautiful job of capturing the diversity of the country and culture. The astonishing landscapes, beautiful people, and vibrant culture. It can all be found all here in this book. Looking at the images, I can't wait to go back to my motherland."" - Marcus Samuelsson, Acclaimed chef, Author, and Restaurateur  Ethiopia: A Photographic Tribute to East Africa's Diverse Cultures &amp; Traditions is a visual ode to every region of the country and a celebration of all the diverse peoples found within.  This highly anticipated volume includes both the iconic landmarks and landscapes found exclusively within Ethiopia, and regions that are lesser known to tourists and travellers. From the cosmopolitan hub of Addis Ababa famous for its Ethiopian Jazz, to the hinterlands of the Gambela region, where the Majang people climb trees over 150 feet tall to collect wild honey. From the north’s Orthodox Tewahedo historic sites, to the Islamic influence spread across the east within Afar and Somali communities, to the Animist spiritualities of the southern nations. The book is a first of its kind—underscoring what makes each region of Ethiopia unique, yet uniting all in one cohesive visual style. Every walk of life is dignified in their own unique way.  The flow of the collection is guided by immersive environmental images, landscapes, and classic still life. Interspersed into the narrative are thoughtful portraits, all photographed within the same “nomadic studio tent” the team built and took across the country. The portraits have a familiarity that only a decade of commitment to a single project can produce. The subjects are introduced by name. One spread of the book shows the same girl, Gure, photographed nearly ten years apart. On the book cover is a rare portrait of Fentale and Woday, two Kereyu men who travel to the market once a week to trade camels and try to meet potential wives with their carefully crafted hairstyles. There is Captain Amsale, a charismatic pilot of Ethiopian Airlines—the first to fly internationally with an all-female flight crew. Deeper within the book, we meet Mories, one of the last remaining subsistence crocodile hunters of the Dassanach, whose nomadic existence is kept alive by following the legends of their ancestors.  These seemingly disconnected cultural threads are woven together masterfully in order to truly see Ethiopia—which itself is the sum of all the diverse lands and the proud people who inhabit it.  300+ COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS: Hundreds of intimate fine art photographs capture the diverse people and landscapes of Ethiopia and East Africa.  STUNNING LANDSCAPES: Joey captures distinct—and often overlooked—natural features of Ethiopia's interior, from its vast deserts, sprawling mountain ranges, and dense forests.  VIBRANT CITIES: Scenes from cities like Addis Ababa reveal a vibrant energy, alight with jazz clubs, musicians, youth culture, and so much more.  DIVERSE CULTURES: Visually explore the Orthodox Tewahedo historic sites, see the Islamic influence on the Afar and Somali communities, and experience the Animist spiritualities of the southern nations.",Joey L.,Books › Higher Education Textbooks › Humanities,5954.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41gBra7cSbL._SX342_SY445.jpg?v=1715062961,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/ethiopia-a-photographic-tribute-to-east-africas-diverse-cultures-traditions-art-photography-books-about-africa

622,9343570772252,Exhalation,"‘One of the most exciting writers in science fiction . . . Although dark in premise, these parables – threaded through with references to ancient mythology and folklore – are filled with hope and humanism: a balm for anxious souls.’ – Daily TelegraphFrom the acclaimed author of Stories of Your Life and Others – the basis for the Academy Award nominated film Arrival – comes a groundbreaking second collection of short fiction: nine stunningly original, provocative, and poignant stories. These are tales that tackle some of humanity’s oldest questions along with new quandaries that only Ted Chiang could imagine. In ‘The Merchant and the Alchemist’s Gate’, a portal through time forces a fabric-seller in ancient Baghdad to grapple with past errors and the temptation of second chances. In the epistolary ‘Exhalation’, an alien scientist makes a shocking discovery with ramifications not just for his own people, but for all of reality. In ‘Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom’, the ability to glimpse into alternate universes necessitates a radically new examination of the concepts of choice and free will. In Exhalation, Ted Chiang addresses the most fundamental of issues – What is the nature of the universe? What does it mean to be human? – alongside others that no one else has even imagined. And, each in its own way, the stories prove that complex and thoughtful science fiction can rise to new heights of beauty, meaning, and compassion.‘Deeply beautiful stories . . . Each thoughtful, elegantly crafted story poses a philosophical question; Chiang curates all nine into a conversation that comes full circle, after having traversed remarkable terrain.’ – New York Times 'The 10 Best Books of 2019'‘Chiang’s writing . . . inspires awe for the natural properties of the universe; it renders the fundamentals of science poignant and affecting.’ – Economist ‘A scintillating cavalcade of ideas . . . Chiang breathes new life into well-worn SF themes such as time travel, artificial intelligence and parallel universes.’ – Financial Times 'Books of the Year'",Ted Chiang,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,371.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51KwEmIAh6L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714996069,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/exhalation
623,9344867959068,Experimental Photography: A Handbook Of Techniques,"The first handbook to systematically detail experimental photographic techniques that manipulate conventional camera technology to create stunning imagesExperimental Photography is the first manual ever to break down into a step-by-step format the experimental techniques that photographers use to subvert or expand conventional camera technology, heralding a new era in photography. The book features technical sections that define a particular process and show how to carry it out, accompanied by examples of the finished images. These are interspersed with illustrated interviews with photographers who use these techniques, examining what their work aims to do and how it is made. Some techniques, such as photograms or lumenprints, are cameraless; others involve building simple cameras from unexpected materials or exploiting the limitations of toy and disposable cameras for artistic effect. Camera hacking—breaking rules in exposure, zooming, panning, focus, and composition; modifying the camera to produce slit-scans; or adding filters—can produce a variety of exciting results. Film can also be manipulated or distressed, and many experiments can be conducted during the preparation of negatives and prints. Even once the print has been produced, creativity continues: mordançage, for example, provides a controlled degrading of the print, and bleaching and encaustic can be used to create new effects. For practicing photographers as well as anyone interested in artistic photographic techniques, this is an unprecedented sourcebook of practical inspiration that celebrates the work of the exceptional artists, “hackers,” and artisans who are pushing the boundaries of how we conceive of photography.",Marco Antonini,"Books › Arts, Film & Photography › Photography",1587.60,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41hcXK5hY-L._SX342_SY445.jpg?v=1715062927,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/experimental-photography-a-handbook-of-techniques

Dance acts as a counterpoint to her life as she shifts between choices early in her career, and provides an anchor as she grows in her profession. The memoir looks at life through the eyes of a woman and the world she encounters, torn between a career, a much-loved art form and family. Key events in Indian history like the Emergency, the Bhopal disaster, the Hindu-Muslim riots are woven into the narrative from the point of view of the impact it had on a young woman’s life. It uses the format or the Margam of a traditional Bharatanatyam stage performance to depict the stages of progression from a young girl, a career woman, a wife and mother, a care-giver, and finally, a woman nearing retirement from a fulfilling career with varied interests to keep her moving forward in life.

Caught entirely off-guard, Siddhartha found himself yearning to evade the moment. What followed became a radiant chapter in the annals of his life.

Sana and Ashish have been dating since the eleventh grade, sharing the kind of teenage romance that makes it to the bestsellers list, sells out theatres and causes their loveless friends to gag. Nothing, not even long-distance, can tear the two apart.
Except, maybe, a handsome, overachieving, book-reading senior from Sana’ s college?
Pranav is the typical ‘ cool guy’ sought after by the entire college. He also happens to be Sana’ s new friend, Aanchal’ s, brother. But he’ s nothing more than a friend! Sana already has the best boyfriend in the world!

Exploring the ways a twenty-year-old navigates grief and life after a loss that shatters most fifty-year-olds, Fool Me Twice looks at the complexity of falling in love 'again' at an age where most are falling for the first time, and what it feels like to move on from mourning one great love to make room for another.",Nona Uppal,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,218.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/516d0Gv4sBL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061133,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/fool-me-twice

Nishi Arora, a twenty-three-year-old from Delhi, the youngest in the Arora family, was a pampered princess. However, behind her cheerful exterior, she harboured a secret, a deep emotion known only to her best friends.

However, his journey to success was far from easy, enduring the heartbreaking loss of his mother and the betrayal of his father at sixteen. His only anchor, his grandfather, left him when he was twenty, causing him to fight against his father for the rightful position of CEO at The Singhania Enterprises, to become ‘The Rishabh Singhania!’
Life has its own way of aligning with our desires, and their story was no exception.
What will happen when she finally meets him again after years of secretly admiring him? Will she hold back or listen to her heart?

What was left of Fred West's eight-year-old stepdaughter was dug up from under the Wests' previous Gloucester home; his first wife and nanny were buried in open country. Most victims had been decapitated and dismembered, their remains showing signs of sexual torture. These twelve are just the ones police found when the Wests were arrested in 1994.

Taken away from his parents, he was brought up in Lhasa according to a monastic regimen of rigorous austerity and in almost total isolation. Aged seven he was enthroned in the 1000-room Potala palace as the supreme spiritual leader of a nation the size of Western Europe, with population of six million. And at fifteen, he became head of state.With Tibet under threat from the newly Communist Chinese, there followed a traumatic decade during which he became the confidant of both Chairman Mao and Jawaharal Nehru as he tried to maintain autonomy for his people. Then in 1959, he was finally forced into exile - followed by over 100,000 destitute refugees.Here, in his own words, he describes what it was like to grow up revered as a deity among his people, reveals his innermost feelings about his role, and discusses the mysteries of Tibetan Buddhism.",The Dalai Lama,"Books › Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts › Biographies & Autobiographies",389.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/412gHNOQbnL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714996084,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/freedom-in-exile

FULL DESCRIPTION:

OH NO! We pick up right where we left off in Part One with Kevin almost dying… again!! What will he find at the bottom of that enormous pit? Will he finally be able to get his hands on some bacon (Ender Kids joke), or will he encounter a new danger? Perhaps a hairy demon with a face covered in evil, red eyes!

So far, we’ve learned two things. 
Thing One: Kevin is pretty much a regular ol’, totally legit superhero baby! He can fight crime and protect himself from danger like the best of them! Well, not all the time. But he’s pretty darn good. And his skills just keep getting better!

Thing Two: The only thing he hasn’t been able to defeat yet is that tall, black monster. The strange purple mist wasn’t just mist after all; it was something much, much more! It seems the dark being is on a mission, but for what? Does it want to kill Kevin? That would make the most sense. But maybe, just maybe, it might be the key to providing some clues about Kevin’s precious sister, Laura.

692,9344849150236,Fundamental Principles Of The Metaphysic Of Morals [Paperback] Immanuel Kant,"""The Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals"" is a philosophical work by Immanuel Kant, published in 1785. In this work, Kant aims to provide a foundation for moral philosophy by outlining the principles of moral reasoning. Kant argues that morality is not based on human desires or emotions, but on a rational understanding of what is universally good. He believes that moral principles should be based on reason alone, rather than on tradition or religious authority. According to Kant, the only thing that is inherently good is a good will, which he defines as a will that acts in accordance with duty. He argues that actions should be judged not on their consequences, but on the motives behind them. Kant also introduces the concept of the categorical imperative, which is a moral principle that applies to all rational beings. The categorical imperative states that we should act only in ways that we would want everyone else to act in similar situations. Overall, ""The Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals"" is a significant work in the history of philosophy and continues to influence contemporary discussions of ethics and morality. It presents a compelling argument for a rational, universal foundation for moral principles.",Immanuel Kant,Books › Higher Education Textbooks › Humanities,99.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51F4ZkS25FL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061958,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/fundamental-principles-of-the-metaphysic-of-morals-paperback-immanuel-kant

SYNOPSIS OF THE NOVEL:- 'Su' (short for Shubho) means good or pure, 'man' is an insightful mind, and 'Kalyan' stands for welfare. Sumankalyan was named so by his parents hoping that he will grow up to be a thoughtful individual looking out for the welfare of others. But little did they think that the young child would grow up to be an exceptional detective. The man was so gifted that he could determine a person's identity, nature of murder, and history just from a severed limb or a body because he had the unique ability to think from a killer's perspective. His complex way of thinking was so unfathomable that it was beyond the author's scope of understanding. In this book, our author follows the detective through his adventures as he unravels one mystery after another.

781,9343549964572,Hidden Mysteries [Paperback] Osho,"""‘Certainly Hindus know many things . . . having been on a religious quest for twenty thousand years.’ In this revealing book, Osho gives new life to the ancient wisdom that was lost when modern India broke its links with the past. The religious rituals still practiced in India are vital keys to past knowledge: ‘living temples’ were constructed with sophisticated acoustics and an awareness that ‘sound is absolute being,’ and the sacred places of pilgrimage arose as places of contact, energy fields where anyone could easily begin their inner journey. ‘Today visiting a place of pilgrimage is just a dead ritual for us . . . What can be seen on the surface is not everything; there are hidden meanings which are not visible from the outside’ Osho ‘Suppose we have a key in our hands. We cannot directly understand the purpose of it from the key itself . . . There are many such keys in life which even today can open the doors to treasures, but unfortunately we neither know anything about these treasures nor about the locks which may be opened’ Osho""",Osho,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,193.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51RfAOucXgL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714995381,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/hidden-mysteries-paperback-osho

Twenty-five years ago, she and her parents, Ewan and Jess, moved into a rambling Victorian estate called Baneberry Hall. They spent three weeks there before fleeing in the dead of night, an ordeal Ewan later recounted in a memoir called House of Horrors. His tale of ghostly happenings and encounters with malevolent spirits became a worldwide phenomenon.Now, Maggie has inherited Baneberry Hall after her father's death. She was too young to remember any of the events mentioned in her father's book. But she doesn't believe a word of it. Ghosts, after all, don't exist.But when she returns to Baneberry Hall to prepare it for sale, her homecoming is anything but warm. People from the pages of her father's book lurk in the shadows, and locals aren't thrilled that their small town has been made infamous. Even more unnerving is Baneberry Hall itself - a place that hints of dark deeds and unexplained happenings. As the days pass, Maggie begins to believe that what her father wrote was more fact than fiction. That, either way, someone - or something - doesn't want her here.

796,9343417483548,Home in the World: A Memoir,"The extraordinary early life in India and England of one of the world's leading public intellectualsWhere is 'home'? For Amartya Sen, home has been many places - Dhaka in modern Bangladesh, the little university town of Santiniketan, where he was raised as much by his grandparents as by his parents, Calcutta where he first studied economics and was active in student movements, and Trinity College, Cambridge, to which he came aged 19. Sen brilliantly recreates the atmosphere in each of these. He remembers his river journeys between Dhaka and his parents' ancestral homes and wonderfully explores the rich history and culture of Bengal. In 1943 he witnessed the disastrous unfolding of the Bengal Famine, and the following year the inflaming of tensions between Hindus and Muslims. In the years before Independence, some of his family were imprisoned for their opposition to British rule. Central to Sen's formation was the intellectually liberating school in Santiniketan founded by Rabindranath Tagore (who gave him his name Amartya) and exciting conversations in the Coffee House on College Street in Calcutta. In Cambridge, he engaged with many of the leading economists and philosophers of the day, especially with the great Marxist thinker Piero Sraffa, who provided a direct connection not only to Wittgenstein, but to Antonio Gramsci and the anti-fascist battles in Italy in the 1920s. After years in Europe and America, the book ends when he returns to Delhi in 1963.Home in the World shows how Sen's experience shaped his ideas - about economics, philosophy, identity, community, famines, gender inequality, social choice and the power of discussion in public life. The joys of learning and the importance of friendship are powerfully conveyed. He invokes some of the great thinkers of the past and his own time - from Ashoka in the third century BC and Akbar in the sixteenth, to David Hume, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, John Maynard Keynes, Maurice Dobb, Kenneth Arrow and Eric Hobsbawm. Above all, Sen emphasises the importance of enlarging our views as much as we can, of human sympathy and understanding across time and distance, and of being at home in the world.",Amartya Sen,Books › Business & Economics › Economics,397.80,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41BHMjlOwsL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994701,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/home-in-the-world-a-memoir

816,9343382847772,How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question,"From the writer and executive producer of the award-winning Netflix series The Good Place that made moral philosophy fun: a fool-proof guide to making the correct moral decision in every situation you ever encounter, anywhere on earth, forever.
How can we live a more ethical life?
This question has plagued people for thousands of years, but it's never been tougher to answer than it is now, thanks to challenges great and small that flood our day-to-day lives and threaten to overwhelm us with impossible decisions and complicated results with unintended consequences.
Plus, being anything close to an 'ethical person' requires daily thought and introspection and hard work; we have to think about how we can be good not, you know, once a month, but literally all the time.
To make it a little less overwhelming, this fascinating, accessible and funny book by one of our generation's best writers and adept minds in television comedy, Michael Schur, boils down the whole confusing morass with real life dilemmas (from 'should I punch my friend in the face for no reason?' to 'can I still enjoy great art if it was created by terrible people?'), so that we know how to deal with ethical dilemmas. Much as Chidi used humour and philosophy to make Eleanor a less selfish person, Schur takes us on a journey through the 2,500-year discussion of ethics, sketching a road map for how we ought to act along the way.
By the time the book is done, we'll know exactly how to act in every conceivable situation, so as to produce a verifiably maximal amount of moral good. We will be perfect, and all our friends will be jealous. Okay, not quite. Instead, we'll gain fresh, funny, inspiring wisdom on the toughest issues we face every day
With contributions from Professor Todd May of Clemson University, who served as an advisor on The Good Place, this is a brilliant, clever and hugely entertaining book about one of the most important topics in the world.

Pink, #1 New York Times bestselling author of When and Drive We are living through a period of unprecedented uncertainty and upheaval in both our personal and professional lives. So it should come as a surprise to exactly no one that trust, human connection, and mental well-being are all on the decline.  This may seem like no laughing matter. Yet, the research shows that humor and laughter are among the most valuable tools we have at our disposal for strengthening bonds and relationships, diffusing stress and tension, boosting resilience, and performing when the stakes are high.   That’s why Jennifer Aaker and Naomi Bagdonas teach the popular course Humor: Serious Business at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where they help some of the world’s most hard-driving, blazer-wearing business minds infuse more humor and levity into their work and lives. In Humor, Seriously, they draw on findings by behavioral scientists, world-class comedians, and inspiring business leaders to reveal how humor works and—more important—how you can use more of it, better. Aaker and Bagdonas unpack the theory and application of humor: what makes something funny, how to mine your life for material, and simple ways to identify and leverage your unique humor style. They show how to use humor to rebuild vital connections; appear more confident, competent, and authentic at work; and foster cultures where levity and creativity can thrive. President Dwight David Eisenhower once said, “A sense of humor is part of the art of leadership, of getting along with people, of getting things done. ” If Dwight David Eisenhower, the second least naturally funny president (after Franklin Pierce), thought humor was necessary to win wars, build highways, and warn against the military-industrial complex, then you might consider learning it too.",Jennifer Aaker,"Books › Health, Family & Personal Development › Self-Help",898.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41xFSYc1E2L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994652,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/humor-seriously-why-humor-is-a-secret-weapon-in-business-and-life

I told him that when I write a book, I would write about another side of him and not just historic events or business milestones. I would write about us and our adventures together, and how I saw him, colours and shades of him unknown to the world. Life beyond the great steel wall of 'industry doyen'.
He agreed. 'There cannot be one book that captures everything ... So you do your thing, give your perspective.'
It was their shared empathy for homeless dogs that sparked an unlikely friendship. In 2014, Shantanu Naidu, an automobile design engineer in his early twenties, developed an innovation to save the local strays from being run over by speeding cars. Ratan Tata, himself known for his compassion for stray dogs, took note. Impressed, he not only decided to invest in the venture, but over the years became a mentor, boss and an unexpectedly dear friend to Shantanu.

By age 16, thousands more hours will have been spent by most of us in some form of disagreement with those in our extended social networks. As a species, we’re well practised at falling out with each other. We may even have a gene for it – certainly, some of us seem to be gifted. When it comes to finding resolutions, however, things don't come quite so naturally: as much as 90% of all interpersonal conflicts never reach agreement. But it doesn’t have to be this way. I Don’t Agree is a fascinating exploration of new, powerful and surprising solutions to an ancient problem: why we disagree so much. It shows how to sidestep our animosities and get great things done, despite our differences.

839,9343523782940,I See the Face : A Novel,"Born in 1953 in Old Dhaka, Shahidul Zahir published only six works in his short life - but these are some of the most unique and powerful works of fiction to have come out of the subcontinent, blending surrealism, folklore, oral storytelling traditions, magic realism, a searing understanding of social and political reality, and rare clarity of vision.
I See the Face is an alternative telling of the story, or history, of Bangladesh, beginning with the War of Liberation in 1971. Moving effortlessly from the past to the present, and back again, Zahir paints a picture of the crisis of post-independence Bangladesh and describes how society or the State drives a poor but brilliant boy to destruction. There is biting wit and humour, and above all, a kind of ethereal understatement which make the reading experience an incomparable one.

847,9343372525852,If Truth Be Told: A Monk's Memoir,"In the 1990s, an eighteen-year-old headed to Australia to realize his worldly dreams. With little money or support, he struggled to survive there. Two years later, he was earning an annual income of $250,000; by the age of twenty-six, he was a multimillionaire. Yet, worldly success was merely a way station on a journey that began years ago. As an eight-year-old, he saw a vision of God in a dream, an experience that left him with a sense of deep joy and peace. The dream triggered off his desire to meet God, to see a manifestation of the Divine. He practiced astrology, intense meditation and tantra, yet God was nowhere in sight. Deeply frustrated, he dived into materialistic pursuits to distract himself from the restlessness within. After years of living the good life, he found he could no longer ignore the old restlessness; worldly pleasures just couldn't fill the void within. He moved back to India and finally did what he had always yearned to do: renounce the world and become a monk. In the Himalayas, in terrifying silence and solitude, Om Swami practised intense meditation. Death was always close as he confronted starvation, the fierce elements and wild animals. Finally, his sadhana brought him to the ultimate realization: I am what I have been seeking. This is an astounding memoir of the making of a spiritual life in today's challenging and often confusing times.

865,9343552094492,Indelicacy,"Shortlisted for the Rathbones Folio Prize 2021'Cain has conjured a protagonist who purged my mind and filled my heart.' -- Claire-Louise Bennett, author of Pond A ghostly feminist fable about class, desire, friendship and the battle to find one's true calling. In an undefined era and place, a cleaning woman at a museum of art aspires to do more than simply dust the paintings around her. She dreams of having the security and time to use her mind, and the liberty to be a writer. She escapes her lot by marrying a rich man, but having gained a husband, a house, high society and a maid, she finds that her new life of privilege is no less constrained. Not only has she taken up different forms of time-consuming labour social and erotic but she is now, however passively, forcing other women to clean up after her. Perhaps a more drastic solution is necessary? Reminiscent of a lost Victorian classic in miniature, Indelicacy is at once a ghost story without a ghost, a fable without a moral and an exploration of the barriers faced by women in both life and literature.'Her bone-clean prose creates a sense of immersion in a story that feels both mythic and true.' -- Guardian'Books don t have to be sagas to make an impression . . . Perhaps it was always Cain's intention to draw in busy readers quickly and easily, then suspend us, helpless and happy, in the extraordinary world she has created, unmoored in time or place.' -- Financial Times'A thing of real delicacy, with a fine, distilled quality to the writing, every word precisely chosen, precisely placed.' -- Observer'An extraordinary feminist fable about women and art.' -- Irish Times 'A novel that will get people talking . . . A Room of One's Own with a few wicked twists.' -- New York Times 'Indelicacy is a short book but it feels brilliantly expansive to read. Cain writes beautiful precise sentences about what it means to wander through this luminous world.' -- Jenny Offill, author of Weather 'Amina Cain is a phenomenal writer. Indelicacy isn't merely a book, it's a world; a world I wanted to live in, forever.' -- Claire-Louise Bennett, author of Pond 'Amina Cain redefines strangeness and freedom in this beautiful and unusual novel that resembles fairy tales and ghost stories but feels intensely contemporary.' -- Alejandro Zambra, author of Multiple Choice 'So exquisite and precise that I felt I wanted to read it constantly, to live inside it . . .

866,9344855736604,Independence,"THREE SISTERS. THEIR UNBREAKABLE BOND. AND A NATION ABOUT TO BE BORN.
Here is a river...
Here is a village...
Here is a grand old mansion...
Here is the country that contains them all...
India. August, 1946. Everything is about to change.
Priya, Jamini and Deepa, Dr Nabakumar Ganguly's daughters, live in Ranipur, Bengal, safe from the rising turbulence in the country. When their father is killed on Direct Action Day, their world turns upside-down.
Priya, the youngest, intelligent and idealistic, is determined to follow in her father's footsteps and become a doctor, no matter how difficult. She is fortunate to have the support of zamindar Somnath Chowdhury, her father's best friend. Jamini, devout, dutiful and talented, helps her mother stitch kanthas to make ends meet. Hungering for affection even as she is resentful of her sisters, she nurses a secret desire. Beautiful Deepa, the eldest, all set to marry well, falls in love with Raza, Youth Leader at the Muslim League, and must face the consequences.
When India is partitioned, the sisters find themselves separated from one another, afraid of what will happen to not only themselves, but also each other. It is only then that they understand what it means to be independent, and the price one has to pay for it.
Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's powerful new novel is a moving story of loyalty and love, nationhood and sisterhood, set against India's independence movement, at once exhilarating and devastating.

867,9343474663708,India that is Bharat,"India, That Is Bharat, the first book of a comprehensive trilogy, explores the influence of European 'colonial consciousness' (or 'coloniality'), in particular its religious and racial roots, on Bharat as the successor state to the Indic civilisation and the origins of the Indian Constitution. It lays the foundation for its sequels by covering the period between the Age of Discovery, marked by Christopher Columbus' expedition in 1492, and the reshaping of Bharat through a British-made constitution-the Government of India Act of 1919. This includes international developments leading to the founding of the League of Nations by Western powers that tangibly impacted this journey. Further, this work also traces the origins of seemingly universal constructs such as 'toleration', 'secularism' and 'humanism' to Christian political theology. Their subsequent role in subverting the indigenous Indic consciousness through a secularised and universalised Reformation, that is, constitutionalism, is examined. It also puts forth the concept of Middle Eastern coloniality, which preceded its European variant and allies with it in the context of Bharat to advance their shared antipathy towards the Indic worldview. In order to liberate Bharat's distinctive indigeneity, 'decoloniality' is presented as a civilisational imperative in the spheres of nature, religion, culture, history, education, language and, crucially, in the realm of constitutionalism.",J Sai Deepak,Books › Politics › Political Theory,555.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51zUHE2fTOL._SY445_SX342_f1bf58e3-4ee4-48e3-b4d9-bbf99269e4d2.jpg?v=1715061791,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/india-that-is-bharat

Why did the people of Khajuraho carve erotic scenes on their temple walls? What did the monks at Nalanda eat for dinner?

In this riveting book, Namit Arora takes us on an unforgettable journey through 5000 years of history, reimagining in rich detail the social and cultural moorings of Indians through the ages. Drawing on credible sources, he discovers what inspired and shaped them: their political upheavals and rivalries, customs and vocations, and a variety of unusual festivals. Arora makes a stop at six iconic places -- the Harappan city of Dholavira, the Ikshvaku capital at Nagarjunakonda, the Buddhist centre of learning at Nalanda, enigmatic Khajuraho, Vijayanagar at Hampi, and historic Varanasi -- enlivening the narrative with vivid descriptions, local stories and evocative photographs. Punctuating this are chronicles of famous travellers who visited India -- including Megasthenes, Xuanzang, Alberuni and Marco Polo -- whose dramatic and idiosyncratic tales conceal surprising insights about our land.

It (became) inevitable, therefore, that politics (formed) a backdrop to her public and often private actions.’ Indira Gandhi’s life spanned over two-thirds of a century. By the time of her brutal assassination in 1984, she had established herself as the most significant political leader India had seen since the death of her father, Jawaharlal Nehru. In this book, written with the close cooperation of her subject, Pupul Jayakar seeks to uncover the many personalities that lay hidden within Mrs. Gandhi. Much more than a political biography, the book reveals the complex personality of Indira Gandhi—her thoughts and feelings, her hates and prejudices, her insights and her faults, her loves and emotional entanglements.

878,9344813859100,Inflation and Unemployment,"About the Book:
About the Book:  ""The book discusses the pertinent topics of unemployment and inflation within the framework of India's seventy-five years of independence. It draws attention to the inability of succeeding administrations to successfully manage the persistent economic issues facing the country. According to the author, mismanagement and corruption are closely related to unemployment and inflation, which are weakening the foundation of society. The conversation about inflation explores its origins and effects while highlighting how much more of a burden it falls on the average person than on corporations. The issue is made worse by improper recording of cash transactions, which encourages tax fraud and reduces the efficacy of policies like the GST. In order to guarantee that customers reap the benefits of GST and prevent inflation, the author proposes changes to invoicing procedures. Similarly, the problem of unemployment is discussed, with the blame for its increase going to a misaligned agenda in education and a dearth of vocational training. The author pushes for a change in educational offerings to better meet industry needs, such as skill-building courses for the building and agricultural industries. This is suggested as a way to address the unemployment issue along with better use of human resources. All in all, the piece offers a provocative examination of two important problems the country is currently experiencing. It provides an understanding of the underlying causes of unemployment and inflation and suggests workable remedies to deal with them. Nonetheless, a more thorough examination of possible policy solutions and their viability would improve the conversation's depth.""

A fire in the heart of Mumbai claims 13 lives, including Mekhala Thampi, India's #1 literary agent known for her controversial books exposing corruption.
The incident triggers public outcry, and the CBI team, led by Yohan Tytler, along with Ila Qureshi and Sukumar Azhagu, is brought in.

894,9344812482844,It Didn''t Start with You,"“This groundbreaking book offers a compelling understanding of inherited trauma and fresh, powerful tools for relieving its suffering. Mark Wolynn is a wise and trustworthy guide on the journey toward healing.” —Tara Brach, PhD, author of Radical Acceptance and True RefugeA groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations, by an acclaimed expert in the field  Depression. Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains—but in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long intuited—that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. It Didn’t Start with You builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score. Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died, or the story has been forgotten or silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood.   As a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty years. It Didn’t Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization, active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming life and health. It Didn’t Start With You is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding difficulties that in many cases, traditional therapy, drugs, or other interventions have not had the capacity to touch.",Mark Wolynn,"Books › Health, Family & Personal Development › Personal Transformation",815.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41nrmlG5N8L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715060018,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/it-didnt-start-with-you

His ability was not limited to Wall Street, though, and his reputation was not bound by the shores of America. He touched core industries in his lifetime, from shipping to power to steel and provided the spark that reignited the economic soul of America after the Crash of 1907.
He had a personal side too. Broken by the death of the love of his life, his once spritely demeanor changed, and he found solace in his work. The more he was befallen with sadness, the harder he worked, never once succumbing to the pressures of a world that was changing right around him.
J.P. Morgan built the financial world we live in today and did it with the might of his mind and the crux of his cane. The mold from which he came has long since been broken, and there is no other man, titan, or genius who has come close to the contributions he made for his industry and his country.

All useful qualifications for the business in hand.' So says Police Chief Macnaghten to Oscar Wilde, in a Chelsea drawing room in the company of Arthur Conan Doyle. The business they are gathered to discuss is none other than the case of Jack the Ripper, the most notorious murderer in England. And thus the three men set out to solve one of the world's most famous mysteries - the ultimate truth about the identity of Jack the Ripper. Case Closed is Arthur Conan Doyle's account of the events of 1894, the year of the return of Jack the Ripper. Based on Oscar Wilde's real-life friendship with Conan Doyle and the extraordinary but little-known fact that in 1894 the detective in charge of the Jack the Ripper investigations was Oscar Wilde's neighbour in Tite Street, Chelsea, this is a revelatory and gripping detective story, combining the intrigue of a classic murder mystery with a witty and compelling portrait of one of the greatest characters of the Victorian age.",Gyles Brandreth,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,183.17,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51btl-bPzvL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062360,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/jack-the-ripper-case-closed

Such a poem is often written in the very last moments of the poet's life.Hundreds of Japanese death poems, many with a commentary describing the circumstances of the poet's death, have been translated into English here, the vast majority of them for the first time. Compiler Yoel Hoffmann explores the attitudes and customs surrounding death in historical and present-day Japan and gives examples of how these have been reflected in the nation's literature in general. The development of writing jisei is then examined--from the longing poems of the early nobility and the more ""masculine"" verses of the samurai to the satirical death poems of later centuries.Zen Buddhist ideas about death are also described as a preface to the collection of Chinese death poems by Zen monks that are also included.

At the same time, he probes the mountain's most memorable sagas in order to illustrate lessons about the fundamental questions mountaineering raises—questions of risk, ambition, loyalty to one's teammates, self-sacrifice, and the price of glory. Viesturs knows the mountain firsthand. He and renowned alpinist Scott Fischer climbed it in 1992 and got caught in an avalanche that sent them sliding to almost certain death before Ed managed to get into a self-arrest position with his ice ax and stop both his fall and Scott's.Focusing on seven of the mountain's most dramatic campaigns, from his own troubled ascent to the 2008 tragedy, Viesturs crafts an edge-of-your-seat narrative that climbers and armchair travelers alike will find unforgettably compelling.

But Hari Singh dreams of a Switzerland-like status for his Himalayan kingdom. Meanwhile, popular leader Sheikh Abdullah rallies for freedom and the Poonchis in western Jammu revolt, telegramming Jinnah for help; soon, fearsome kabailis are carving a swath of savagery and destruction through the kingdom towards Srinagar.

Vijayanagara, 1485. The second son of a famed army commander, Tuluva Krishna sees around him a decaying empire assailed by the treachery of vassals and the belligerence of neighbours. Determined to restore peace and glory to the Vijayanagara Samrajya, Krishna, hot-headed and impatient, follows in his father's footsteps and begins his military service under Emperor Saluva Narasimha.
Peace, though, is hard to forge, and Krishna's loyalty, ingenuity and persistence towards his singular cause are constantly tested, both on and off the battlefield. Fuelled by his passion and his dreams of one day uniting with his true love – the rebellious, enigmatic temple dancer, Chinna – Krishna quickly rises through the ranks.

Dazzling and hallucinatory, the stories in this collection recall the masters of magical realism - but with Sara Gallardo's distinctive slant. An old man wakes up one morning to find that his beloved garden is floating away, with him on board. A young woman moves to Buenos Aires, bringing with her a replacement head. A meek German missionary leaves Paraguay for the Pampas, unprepared for what he will discover there.

Part of the Pushkin Press Classics series: timeless storytelling by icons of literature, hand-picked from around the globe.

There’s been a spate of cattle rustling, and even some gunplay to try and scare them off.But as the A Bar has no proof of Bannerman’s hustling and with the range outside of Al’s jurisdiction, there’s nothing to be done.

In fact, Elizabeth Zott would be the first to point out that there is no such thing as an average woman. But it’s the early 1960s and her all-male team at Hastings Research Institute takes a very unscientific view of equality. Except for one: Calvin Evans; the lonely, brilliant, Nobel–prize nominated grudge-holder who falls in love with—of all things—her mind. True chemistry results. But like science, life is unpredictable. Which is why a few years later Elizabeth Zott finds herself not only a single mother, but the reluctant star of America’s most beloved cooking show Supper at Six.

Like everything in life-at least everything worth having-it wasn't that simple. There was blood, sweat and tears, there was loss of capital, loss of friendship and even a loss of faith along the way.It started with a phone call from Harpreet's mother introducing him to an uncle who wanted some help. Or maybe it started when Vibhore and Harpreet met as roommates in Room 143 at IIT Bombay. What remains true is that soon both had quit their jobs and launched CoCubes. From no money in their bank accounts for eight years after graduating to becoming dollar millionaires two years later in 2016, this is a tale of grit-of a company built in India by two Indian-middle-class-twenty-somethings-turned-entrepreneurs-written in the hope that you can avoid the mistakes they made and learn from what they did right.

When he was in school one day his teacher called him an IMBECILE. For him, it was a new word. He asks his father what it means. His father looking at its meaning in an English-Marathi dictionary tells him that an imbecile is a CLEVER PERSON. He feels proud upon hearing its meaning. As he grows up several people call him an imbecile including his mother, his first love, his wife, and his extramarital lover, etc. At one point he bursts out in rage because he realizes what its real meaning is. He gets frustrated over it but can’t do anything. At one point he says the word is coined by women. To remove it from the dictionary he would go to the international court.He never understands why he is an imbecile. Why does everyone call him an imbecile? Before telling his story in the prologue he says as the title suggests it’s about me. You may wonder who I am. I’m the protagonist, the hero, the narrator, the not-stop talker, the empty-headed imbecile.Living in a society like India calling someone imbecile is an appropriate thing? Or being an Indian abusing someone imbecile is it a birthright? Why doesn’t it count as an act of harassment under any law? Why doesn’t the law consider it as a swear word? Or is it that Indian considers it saying like they say moron or stupid to somebody unconditionally? Who gives them the right?In a parallel life, Dattatray lives the life of a pujari, a Hindu Brahmin priest’s son. His father’s connection with an organization influences him a lot.

He decides not to tell his daughters about it.Living two different lives parallelly Dattatray has to face several consequences being a son, a subordinate, a Brahmin, a husband, and an ex-lover.

Transport, Vegetables - 3 to 6 years old [Paperback] Maple Press","Colouring is a therapeutic activity that has several benefits, including providing relaxation and reducing stress and anxiety. As children perceive the world in colour, they learn by association and recognition. Thus, it is vital for them to learn to differentiate between colours.
This set of colouring books includes some of the most common things children find in the world around them. When they notice vegetables, modes of transport, flowers, fruits, birds and animals in the books, they instantly connect them to what they had previously seen in the real world. As they associate memories with the images, they are able to recognise the colours and shapes of each object. Further, with time, they also gain awareness of colour, which gives them a chance to experiment with shades.
Finally, the act of colouring strengthens their fine motor skills, improves eye-hand coordination and develops concentration. Let children learn and explore their creativity with this set of books and discover the artist within themselves.

1009,9343263605020,Living Spirituality,"The subject of spirituality has become an elusive one. And with so many paths, ideologies, beliefs, masters, and gurus, where each is convinced of their superiority, it has become impossible to know what amounts to true spirituality. Living spirituality has been written to remove this veil of confusion and distortion that shrouds spirituality and put the control back into your hands. The author offers a deeply insightful and rational understanding of the subject that aims to clarify and illuminate the truly spiritual life. Not only that, but the book also addresses various queries and tribulations that one is bound to confront when on a spiritual journey. This includes: do we need a master or Guru to be on the path of spirituality? How can we bridge the gap between spirituality in words and spirituality in one’s actions? What makes spirituality different from philosophy and religion? What is the difference between spirituality and escapism?... And many more The central br&gt;Theme of the book is to make spirituality accessible.

1024,9344859210012,Long Walk To Water: Based on a True Story,"Cherished by millions of readers, this #1 New York Times bestselling novel is a powerful tale of perseverance and hope. Newbery Medalist Linda Sue Park interweaves the stories of two Sudanese children who overcome mortal dangers to improve their lives and the lives of others.
A Long Walk to Water begins as two stories, told in alternating sections, about two eleven-year-olds in Sudan, a girl in 2008 and a boy in 1985. The girl, Nya, is fetching water from a pond that is two hours’ walk from her home: she makes two trips to the pond every day. The boy, Salva, becomes one of the “lost boys” of Sudan, refugees who cover the African continent on foot as they search for their families and for a safe place to stay.
Enduring every hardship from loneliness to attack by armed rebels to contact with killer lions and crocodiles, Salva is a survivor, and his story goes on to intersect with Nya’s in an astonishing and moving way. Includes an afterword by author Linda Sue Park and the real-life Salva Dut, on whom the novel is based, and who went on to found Water for South Sudan.",Linda Sue Park,Books › Children's Books › Growing Up & Facts of Life,759.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41MoNf5-4nL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062477,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/long-walk-to-water-based-on-a-true-story

1030,9343533613340,Love Life: Billionaire Dance School Hot Romance (Love You Series Book 1),"From international bestselling author, Lexy Timms, comes a forbidden romance that'll set your heart racing. 

She'd given up on love. He didn't have time for it. She thinks he's a stuck up pretty boy who doesn't care about anyone but himself, and he thinks she's a stuck up prude who wouldn't know how to ""put out"" if she tried. And yet... 

Antonio Riverra AKA Tony Rivers comes from a lower class background, raised in the rough streets of gang-infested L.A. His only saving grace was his mother who was a dance teacher. However, Tony kept his knowledge of ballet a highly-guarded secret. He’s applied for early admission to a number of California performing arts colleges, but earned a scholarship to small but prestigious school, the San Oaho College of Visual and Performing Arts. 

Allison (Allie) Holbrook is the rebellious daughter of a rich man. She doesn’t know her mother, as she was abandoned on her father’s doorstep when she was three. Since a paternity test confirmed she was his, Jefferson Holbrook took financial but not emotional responsibility for her. He had a nanny care for her until she was old enough to go to boarding school. She’s had the best of everything but good role models. Because her father controls everything about her life, and Jefferson believes the only thing a rich man’s daughter should do is marry a rich man’s son, he sends her off to the San Oaho College of Visual and Performing Arts while he finds her a husband. 

Does love have limits? At what cost? 

Out of nowhere, when Allie least expects it, Tony crashes into her life. Now, the stakes have never been higher.

The many lives of theoretical physicist Elsie Hannaway have finally caught up with her. By day, she's an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend, tapping into her expertly honed people-pleasing skills to embody whichever version of herself the client needs.

Now expanded with new reader oriented lessons, and a powerful and transformative personal story of the practice in action.
Kamal Ravikant knows misery well. In 2011, the company Kamal had spent the last ten years of his life nurturing and growing, suddenly and embarrassingly went under. He experienced a profound depression, the kind that made him physically ill and bedridden. The only source of light in this darkest moment was a meditation, a chant that came to him and provided the only source of comfort he could muster: I love myself.
Kamal began his transformational journey by repeating this over and over to himself. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. Even when he didn’t believe it (especially when he didn’t believe it).This meditation grew in the form of a system of tools for keeping him positive, balanced, and moving forward. Kamal’s spiritual healing changed his physical and emotional states, and his entire person shifted for the better.
Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It is the powerful story of Kamal’s radical self-growth journey and his specific practice for readers.

Longlisted for the 2024 Women AutHer Awards Best Author (Nonfiction)
‘A great fighter who accepts no nonsense and is willing to call a spade a spade … (Meeran Chadha Borwankar’s) reputation as an honest, competent and fair-minded police officer preceded her wherever she was posted.' Julio Ribeiro, Tribune
‘What an extraordinary story’ Cyrus Broacha, Cyrus Says
‘Interesting, informative and explosive’ Global Governance News
‘Looks back at (Meeran Chadha Borwankar’s) thirty-six years in service, recounts the changes and what more needs to be done’ Hindu
‘Gripping … vivid and inspiring … a must-read for those who care for law enforcement’ Indian Express
The incredible memoir from one of India’s most uncompromising police officers.
Meeran Chadha Borwankar graduated from India’s National Police Academy as the sole woman of its 1981 batch. From there, she would go on to investigate a long string of sensitive and controversial cases, fighting crime together with corruption and discrimination, never compromising on her integrity. Meeran’s steadfast efforts saw her become Maharashtra’s first female district police chief as well as its first woman police commissioner. She also held senior roles at the Central Bureau of Investigation and Mumbai’s crime branch, eventually retiring as Director General of the Bureau of Police Research and Development and the National Crime Records Bureau. All through she remained unafraid to critique the country’s criminal justice system, challenging even those in the highest echelons until the rule of law prevailed.
In this candid account of her thirty-six years in Indian law enforcement, Meeran details the sensational cases that defined her career: from the Jalgaon sex scandal to jewellery heists, highway dacoities to communal riots, brutal murders to gang rapes, port thefts to financial frauds, and brushes with notorious criminals such as Chhota Rajan and Dawood Ibrahim’s sister Haseena Parkar. As the state prisons chief, she navigated intense media and government pressure while overseeing Sanjay Dutt’s imprisonment and the executions of Ajmal Kasab and Yakub Memon, thereby outlining both the significance and challenges of donning the khaki.
Gripping, thought-provoking and always inspiring, Madam Commissioner is as honest a memoir can get about life as a woman officer of the Indian Police Service. It is essential reading for anyone interested in the uniform and indeed for concerned citizens everywhere.",Meeran Chadha Borwankar,Books › Higher Education Textbooks › Law,316.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41u67cOEMUL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994544,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/madam-commissioner-the-extraordinary-life-of-an-indian-police-chief

1045,9343351193884,Magical Realism and Deleuze: The Indiscernibility of Difference in Postcolonial Literature,"Since the success of Gabriel García Márquez's 1967 novel One Hundred Years of Solitude and the following Latin American literary 'boom' of the late sixties and seventies, magical realism has had a steady following, an international influence and become established as a literary genre. Yet its definition has remained vague. Through the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, this study rethinks magical realism, making an argument for using Deleuzian readings of literature in general while dealing with the implications of a new approach for prevalent postcolonial studies in particular. With One Hundred Years of Solitude used as a model, Eva Aldea takes a Deleuzian approach to major Anglophone works by Rushdie, Okri, Morrison and Ghosh. She shows how the power of magical realism lies not, as is commonly held, in its subversion of the real and the magical, but in allowing the two to remain radically different and yet indiscernible at the same time, challenging existing readings of the genre.",Eva Aldea,"Books › Language, Linguistics & Writing › Linguistics",442.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41A18I5okbL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994420,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/magical-realism-and-deleuze-the-indiscernibility-of-difference-in-postcolonial-literature

1055,9344849543452,"Maktub: The essential companion to global bestseller, The Alchemist","An essential companion to the inspirational classic The Alchemist, filled with timeless stories of reflection and rediscovery.
From one of the greatest writers of our age comes a collection of stories and parables unlocking the mysteries of the human condition. Gathered from Paulo Coelho’s daily column of the same name, Maktub, meaning “it is written,” invites seekers on a journey of faith, self-reflection, and transformation. As Paulo Coelho explains, ‘Maktub is not a book of advice―but an exchange of experiences.’
Each story offers an illuminated path to see life and the lives of our fellow people around the world in new ways, allowing us to tap into universal truths about our collective and individual humanity. As Coelho writes, ‘a man who seeks only the light, while shirking his responsibilities, will never find illumination. And one who keep his eyes fixed upon the sun . . . ends up blind.’ In these wise tales akin to Zen koans and other mysteries of the universe, there are talking snakes, old women climbing mountains, disciples querying their masters, Buddha in dialogue, mysterious hermits, and many saints.
Following the path of his previous internationally bestselling works, this thoughtful collection of short, inspirational pieces, introduced in a foreword by the author and illustrated with black-and-white line art throughout, will engage seekers of all ages and backgrounds.",Paulo Coelho,"Books › Health, Family & Personal Development › Self-Help",372.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51MMHNRD3yL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061983,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/maktub-the-essential-companion-to-global-bestseller-the-alchemist

Only those who allowed their inner hold on their moral and spiritual selves to subside eventually fell victim to the camp's degenerating influence - while those who made a victory of those experiences turned them into an inner triumph.Frankl came to believe that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose.

While she may undoubtedly be helpful in some instances, chronicler and Auschwitz survivor Hermann Langbein claims that she also ""ordered beatings and gave beatings herself.""
Examining the terrifying life and deeds of one of the most infamous female SS guards in Nazi history, this ""Maria Mandl Biography Book"" The tale of Maria Mandl is one of cruelty, horror, and indifference to human suffering, starting from her early years in the Austrian Nazi organization and ending with her ascent to the position of Oberaufseherin (Head Supervisor) in Auschwitz II.
Mandl creates a horrific legacy as she rises through the SS ranks, supervising the whipping and torturing of many women in camps such as Ravensbrück and Lichtenburg. She is known as ""the beast,"" nevertheless, because of her time spent at Auschwitz II, where she oversaw the selection process that decided who would survive and who would perish in the gas chambers.
But even in the middle of the horrors, Mandl exhibits an odd love of music, directing the creation of an orchestra made up of wealthy prisoners as she sentences others to death. Mandl is put on trial for her crimes as the war comes to an end, but the tremendous weight of the evidence undermines her argument that she was just thinking about the welfare of the inmates.
The compelling narrative ""Maria Mandl Biography Book"" illuminates one of the darkest periods in human history by examining the depths of human depravity and the human spirit's resiliency in the face of unfathomable evil.

Like no other concept and like no other space, the collection of knowledge, learning, and imagination offers a sense of infinite possibility. It’s the unrivaled realm of discovery, where every faded manuscript or mighty clothbound tome might reveal a provocative new idea, a far-flung fantasy, an ancient belief, a religious conviction, or a whole new way of being in the world.In this new photographic journey, Massimo Listri travels to some of the oldest and finest libraries to reveal their architectural, historical, and imaginative wonder. Through great wooden doors, up spiraling staircases, and along exquisite, shelf-lined corridors, he leads us through outstanding private, public, educational, and monastic libraries, dating as far back as 766. Between them, these medieval, classical, baroque, rococo, and 19th-century institutions hold some of the most precious records of human thought and deed, inscribed and printed in manuscripts, volumes, papyrus scrolls, and incunabula. In each, Listri’s poised images capture the library’s unique atmosphere, as much as their most prized holdings and design details.Featured libraries include the papal collections of the Vatican Apostolic Library and the Trinity College Library, home to the Book of Kells and Book of Durrow. With meticulous descriptions accompanying each featured library, we learn not only of the libraries’ astonishing holdings—from which highlights are illustrated—but also of their often lively, turbulent, or controversial pasts. Like the Franciscan monastery in Lima, Peru, with its horde of archival Inquisition documents.At once a bibliophile beauty pageant, an ode to knowledge, and an evocation of the particular magic of print, this compact edition of our best-selling XXL-title is above all a cultural-historical pilgrimage to the heart of our halls of learning, to the stories they tell, as much as those they gather in printed matter along polished shelves.",Elisabeth Sladek,Books › Higher Education Textbooks › Humanities,2395.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51lIIowtMML._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715060826,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/massimo-listri-the-world-s-most-beautiful-libraries

In time, his thoughts took a darker turn, and he became preoccupied with the idea that cars were following him, or that strangers wanted to harm him. Kurt's mind had been hijacked by schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder that typically strikes during the late teen or young adult years.  In Me, Myself, and Them, Kurt, now an adult, looks back from the vantage point of recovery and eloquently describes the debilitating changes in thoughts and perceptions that took hold of his life during his teens and twenties. As a memoir, this book is remarkable for its unvarnished look at the slow and difficult process of coming back from severe mental illness. Yet Kurt's memoir is only half the story. With the help of psychiatrist Raquel E. Gur, M.D., Ph.D., and veteran science writer Linda Wasmer Andrews, Kurt paints the big picture for others affected by adolescent schizophrenia. Drawing on the latest scientific and medical evidence, he explains how to recognize warning signs, where to find help, and what treatments have proved effective. Kurt also offers practical advice on topics of particular interest to young people, such as suggestions on managing the illness at home, school, and work, and in relationships with family and friends.

1095,9343372558620,Memoirs of A Maverick : The First Fifty Years (1941–1991),"Of India’s civil servants, Mani Shankar Aiyar may have arguably had one of the most colourful careers. Known for his lacerating wit and many indiscretions, with a career that has seen great highs and lows, he has been a true maverick.
In this extraordinarily honest memoir, he tells the story of his first fifty years – from his childhood at Dehradun where he was raised by his feisty widowed mother to nearly becoming the president of the Cambridge Union, to working as a young diplomat who strengthened Indo–Pak ties by brilliantly managing India’s first consulate general in Karachi and then going on to work intimately with Rajiv Gandhi in the PMO.
Candid, funny and thoughtful, Aiyar writes sparklingly about his childhood and college days, of his parents’ troubled marriage and his beloved youngest brother’s suicide, and insightfully about the countries he served in – observing that the net level of freedom in both India and Pakistan were about the same because Zia’s dictatorship was as inefficient as India’s democracy, and that Saddam Hussein’s government was unusually feminist with a large number of female public servants. And he draws, too, a revelatory and moving picture of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Above all, he doesn’t spare himself.

Both men are happy and settled in their respective lives when they come across a shocking truth.
When Venkatesh realises he has a half-brother from his father's extramarital liaison, his world changes. He finds his step-mother out and is pained to see the pitiful condition she is living in. He must make amends for what his father has done but the question that haunts him deep within is if it is really possible to undo everything. Mukesh is in a similar state of agony when he comes to know that he was adopted as a kid. Pushed by impulse, he decides to find his biological mother. But the farther he goes, the more unclear the picture becomes. He must decide towards whom his true love and loyalty lies: the woman whom he called his mother all his life and who raised him or the woman who has given him birth.
The two men are bound by the same dilemma and the same complexity of emotions. and it is important for them to find their way back to bring stability in their lives. The core interest of the book is in exploring if it is really possible to come to terms with a reality as blaring and as deceiving as that of Venkatesh and Mukesh.

1223,9343433736476,Narrative and Numbers: The Value of Stories in Business,"How can a company that has never turned a profit have a multibillion dollar valuation? Why do some start-ups attract large investments while others do not? Aswath Damodaran, finance professor and experienced investor, argues that the power of story drives corporate value, adding substance to numbers and persuading even cautious investors to take risks. In business, there are the storytellers who spin compelling narratives and the number-crunchers who construct meaningful models and accounts. Both are essential to success, but only by combining the two, Damodaran argues, can a business deliver and sustain value. Damodaran considers Uber's debut and how narrative is key to understanding different valuations. He investigates why Twitter and Facebook were valued in the billions of dollars at their public offerings, and why one (Twitter) has stagnated while the other (Facebook) has grown. He also looks at more established business models such as Apple and Amazon to demonstrate how a company's history can both enrich and constrain its narrative. Narrative and Numbers reveals the benefits, challenges, and pitfalls of weaving narratives around numbers and how one can best test a story's plausibility.",Aswath Damodaran,Books › Business & Economics › Analysis & Strategy,343.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41V7wHGUFDL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994774,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/narrative-and-numbers-the-value-of-stories-in-business

NEXT DOOR (A Chloe Fine Mystery) is book #1 in a new psychological suspense series by bestselling author Blake Pierce, whose #1 bestseller Once Gone (Book #1) (a free download) has received over 1,000 five star reviews. 

FBI Evidence Response Team intern Chloe Fine, 27, finds herself forced to confront her own dark past when her troubled twin sister needs her help—and when a body turns up dead in her small, suburban town.

Chloe feels life is finally perfect as she moves back into her home town, and into a new house with her fiancé. Her career with the FBI looks promising, and her wedding is on the horizon. 

But, she learns, all is not as it seems in suburbia. Chloe begins to see the underside—the gossip, the secrets, the lies—and she finds herself haunted by her own demons: her mother’s mysterious death when she was 10, and her father’s imprisonment. 

And when a fresh body is found, Chloe soon realizes that her past, and this small town, might hold the key to solving both.

An emotionally wrought psychological suspense with layered characters, small-town ambiance and heart-pounding suspense, NEXT DOOR is book #1 in a riveting new series that will leave you turning pages late into the night. 

Book #2 in the CHLOE FINE series is also now available!",Blake Pierce,"Kindle Store › Kindle eBooks › Crime, Thriller & Mystery",0.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41U2SjF3VsL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715060410,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/next-door-a-chloe-fine-psychological-suspense-mystery-book-1

1287,9343559139612,Of Smokeless Fire,"Djinns-the invisible beings made of smokeless fire are Allah's creations. Human beings cannot create or beget them, but whether it was a djinn or not, a rumour took birth that day that a djinn was born at the residence of Noor ul Haq, bar-at-law. So begins the story of a lifelong friendship between three unlikely children. Mansoor, the rumoured djinn, who balances his love and loyalty between his devoutly religious mother and his erudite, alcoholic father. Mehrun, the churail-a Medusa-like creature-who struggles to get an English-medium education, the elusive ticket out of poverty. And Joseph, the bhangi, a derisive name for a sweeper, who dreams of becoming a movie star as he cleans the toilets of the rich and powerful. Wearing their insults like a garland, they transgress society's norm and follow their dreams. Their lives intimately tied to the vagaries of Pakistan's politics, alternating between tragedies and triumphs.Of Smokeless Fire is a story about belonging and displacement. It is a reminder that belonging is not just about allegiance, and exile is not just physical. The novel asks the questions: Once you are ripped from your homeland, do you become homeless forever? What does it mean to live in a land that has forsaken you? Whether rooted or uprooted, is your relationship with your country conditioned by its politics?",A.A.

Born in Vietnam to a Vietnamese mother and Indian father, Sobhraj grew up with a fluid sense of identity, moving to France before being imprisoned and stripped of his multiple nationalities. Driven to floating from country to country, continent to continent, he became the consummate con artist, stealing passports, smuggling drugs and guns across Asia, busting out of prisons and robbing wealthy associates. But as his situation grew more perilous he turned to murder, preying on Western tourists dropping out across the 1970s hippie route, leaving a trail of dead bodies and gruesome crime scenes in his wake. First published in 1979, but updated here to include new material, On the Trail of the Serpent draws its readers into the story of Sobhraj's life as told exclusively to journalists Richard Neville and Julie Clarke.

—Reader review for Only Murder
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
“A brilliant book. I couldn’t put it down and I never guessed who the murderer was!”—Reader review for Only Murder⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ONLY MURDER (a Sadie Price FBI Suspense Thriller—Book 1) is the debut novel in a new series by mystery and suspense author Rylie Dark.Special Agent Sadie Price, a 29-year-old rising star in the FBI’s BAU unit, stuns her colleagues by requesting reassignment to the FBI’s remote Alaskan field office. Back in her home state, a place she vowed she would never return, Sadie, running from a secret in her recent past and back into her old one, finds herself facing her demons—including her sister’s unsolved murder—while assigned to hunt down a new serial killer.Two women are found dead in a remote area of Northern Alaska, near Sadie’s hometown, floating under the ice, their bodies preserved, much the same way Sadie’s own murdered sister was found—a memory that still plagues her. The case strikes way too close to home, blurring Sadie’s judgment, stirring up memories of her estranged father and murdered sister, memories she’s not ready to grapple with.This part of Alaska—icy, rough, remote, populated by outcasts—proves impenetrable even for a seasoned FBI agent like Sadie. The killer, matching his landscape, is more sinister and smart than anyone Sadie has encountered.

1311,9344865960220,"Our History, Their History, Whose Histor (The India List)","An overview of nationalism and its impact on the study of history from one of India’s most prominent historians.   In this timely book, historian Romila Thapar delves into the complex world of nationalism and its impact on the interpretations of the past and on the discipline of history itself. History, she expounds, is no mere collection of information and chronology, and its purpose extends well beyond storytelling.   Recognizing nationalism as a powerful force that gives rise to various narratives that provide ancestry to communities and shape the direction of societies, Thapar explores how, in India, two conflicting notions of nationalism have evolved and shaped the idea of the nation. Today, one such nationalistic theory claims the victimization of one religious community by another through centuries of “misrule.” Such a claim willfully ignores ample evidence to the contrary to suit a particular political and ideological purpose. Thapar counters such attempts at misrepresentation by citing several historical instances of the nuanced interface and intermingling of cultures, as well as by showing how today’s conflicts have their roots in the British colonial construction of India’s history. She also addresses the recent controversy surrounding the deletions of sections of Indian history textbooks published by NCERT, the Indian educational council, and suggests that the intention is more likely to be the promotion of a particular reading of history that conforms to the ideology of those in power.   Engaging and thought-provoking, Our History, Their History, Whose History? invites readers to question the authenticity of historical narratives touted by one group of nationalists, and it explores the clash between professional historians who study the past to understand our inherited present and fabricators who wield history for political gain.",Romila Thapar,Books › Politics › Political Ideologies,313.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/31Ld4dQeSVL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062830,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/our-history-their-history-whose-histor-the-india-list

1327,9344829358364,Painting with Light 2e,"Few cinematographers have had as decisive an impact on the cinematic medium as John Alton. Best known for his highly stylized film noir classics ""T-Men"", ""He Walked by Night"", and ""The Big Combo"", Alton earned a reputation during the 1940s and 1950s as one of Hollywood's consummate craftsmen through his visual signature of crisp shadows and sculpted beams of light. No less renowned for his virtuoso color cinematography and deft appropriation of widescreen and Technicolor, he earned an Academy Award in 1951 for his work on the musical ""An American in Paris"". First published in 1949, ""Painting With Light"" remains one of the few truly canonical statements on the art of motion picture photography, an unrivaled historical document on the workings of postwar American cinema. In simple, non-technical language, Alton explains the job of the cinematographer and explores how lighting, camera techniques, and choice of locations determine the visual mood of film. Todd McCarthy's introduction provides an overview of Alton's biography and career and explores the influence of his work on contemporary cinematography and the foreword, written expressly for this edition by award-winning cinematographer John Bailey, explores Alton's often contentious relationships with colleagues, the American Society of Cinematographers, and the movie industry itself.",John Alton,"Books › Arts, Film & Photography › Cinema & Broadcast",3390.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41kAIEs1nTL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715060900,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/painting-with-light-2e

1353,9344837353756,Penguin 35 Collectors Edition: Chowringhee,"Here, day and night were interchangeable. The immaculately dressed Chowringhee, radiant in her youth, had just stepped on to the floor at the nightclub.' Set in 1950s Calcutta, Chowringhee is a sprawling saga of the intimate lives of managers, employees and guests at one of Calcutta's largest hotels, the Shahjahan. Shankar, the newest recruit, recounts the stories of several people whose lives come together in the suites, restaurants, bar and backrooms of the hotel. As both observer and participant in the events, he inadvertently peels off the layers of everyday existence to expose the seamy underbelly of unfulfilled desires, broken dreams, callous manipulation and unbidden tragedy. What unfolds is not just the story of individual lives but also the incredible chronicle of a metropolis. Written by best-selling Bengali author Sankar, Chowringhee was published as a novel in 1962. Predating Arthur Hailey's Hotel by three years, it became an instant hit, spawning translations in major Indian languages, a film and a play. Its larger-than-life characters-the enigmatic manager Marco Polo, the debonair receptionist Sata Bose, the tragic hostess Karabi Guha, among others-soon attained cult status. With its thinly veiled accounts of the private lives of real-life celebrities, and its sympathetic narrative seamlessly weaving the past and the present, it immediately established itself as a popular classic. Available for the first time in English, Chowringhee is as much a dirge as it is a homage to a city and its people.",Arunava Sinha,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,421.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/4188mu0dazL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061352,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/penguin-35-collectors-edition-chowringhee

Bhanver,"On 10 August 2015, an unassuming product expert who learnt his ropes at IIT Kharagpur was declared the next CEO of tech giant Google. Sundar Pichai's appointment was hardly an unexpected one. Pichai is a man known as much for his veritable Midas touch with every product he has developed for Google – Chrome, Chrome OS and Android to just name a few - as for his superlative people skills and calm approach to innovation and creativity. Yet, the company's decision to restructure its product lines and Pichai's appointment as the head of a leaner, more focused Google, has raised inevitable questions: What does Pichai's role indicate for the future of the tech giant? Will Google consolidate its position for existing products or will they focus on creating new ones? And will Pichai transform the organization that Page and Brinn created and led, or confirm the belief of a minority of naysayers that he is not yet ready for this daunting role? Pichai: The Future of Google examines these questions and more. Combining reportage and analysis, it throws light on Sundar Pichai's childhood and education, his entry into the tech world and quick rise up the ranks in Google, his experience with two different leaders, Schmidt and Page, and the takeaways from the Larry Page era, and his key contributions as a leader and tech-guru to Google's most successful properties.

Legendary spy and art restorer Gabriel Allon has at long last severed ties with Israeli intelligence and settled quietly in Venice, the only place he has ever truly known peace. His beautiful wife, Chiara, has taken over day-to-day management of the Tiepolo Restoration Company, and their two young children are clandestinely enrolled in a neighborhood scuola elementare. For his part, Gabriel spends his days wandering the streets and canals of the watery city, parting company with the demons of his tragic, violent past.

Gabriel soon discovers that the work in question, a portrait of an unidentified woman attributed to Sir Anthony van Dyck, is almost certainly a fiendishly clever fake.

As the novel spans time and multiple points of view, we meet the people connected to Ruby: her birth parents and grandparents; her adoptive parents; the men and women Ruby has been romantically involved with; a beloved uncle; and Ruby’s children. Taken together, these characters form a kaleidoscope of stories, giving Ruby’s life dignity and meaning.Probably Ruby is a dazzling novel about a bold, unapologetic woman taking control of her life and story, and marks the debut of a major new voice in Indigenous fiction.",Lisa Bird-Wilson,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,231.32,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/61Kt200CUPL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061130,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/probably-ruby-a-novel

But you must, at the same time, remember that these divisions are not very marked and quite exclusive of each other. Each blends into the other. But according to the type which prevails, we name the divisions. It is not that you can find men who have no other faculty than that of work, nor that you can find men who are no more than devoted worshippers only, nor that there are men who have no more than mere knowledge. These divisions are made in accordance with the type or the tendency that may be seen to prevail in a man. We have found that, in the end, all these four paths converge and become one.

1465,9344851837212,Religio Medici and Urne-Buriall (New York Review Books Classics),"Sir Thomas Browne is one of the supreme stylists of the English language: a coiner of words and spinner of phrases to rival Shakespeare; the wielder of a weird and wonderful erudition; an  inquiring spirit in the mold of Montaigne. Browne was an inspiration to the Romantics as well as to W.G. Sebald, and his work is quirky, sonorous, and enchanting. Here this baroque master’s two most enduring and admired works, Religio Medici and Urne-Buriall, appear in a new edition that has been annotated and introduced by the distinguished scholars Ramie Targoff and Stephen Greenblatt (author of the best-selling Will in the World and the National Book Award–winning The Swerve). In Religio Medici Browne mulls over the relation between his medical profession and his profession of the Christian faith, pondering the respective claims of science and religion, questions that are still very much alive today.

The arch-rivals of the Yaduvanshis, rulers of North Kosala and the former rulers of South Kosala, the Raghuvanshis of the Ikshvaku lineage are resolute to settle their score with the Yaduvanshis and to reconquer the state. With tact and shrewdnes, they incite neighbouring Nishada tribes to launch guerrilla attacks on South Kosala.

1470,9344864616732,Revisiting The Educational Heritage Of India,"Long before the first European universities appeared, India already had multi-disciplinary centres of learning that fuelled a knowledge revolution around the world. This book fills a dire need to chronicle the great educational heritage of India. It describes a unique ecosystem which ensured that Gurus and Acharyas handed the lamp of learning to generations of students. As the author puts it, “When swords quenched their thirst and famine ravaged the lands, Indians still held on to their truth that there was nothing more purifying than knowledge.” She has collated information from oral history, local lore, travelogues, surviving literature, inscriptions, salvaged manuscripts and accounts of scholars and laity. Historically, the book covers a vast time span from ancient India’s traditions to the deliberate destruction of its heritage. It also outlines steps that can be taken today to incorporate the most relevant aspects of ancient learning systems into the current structure of school and university education.",Sahana Singh,Books › History,451.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51Q9hGZ4MbL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062758,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/revisiting-the-educational-heritage-of-india
1471,9344866124060,Revolutionaries: The Other Story of How India Won Its Freedom,"The history of India's struggle for freedom is usually told from the perspective of the non-violent movement. Yet, the story of armed resistance to colonial occupation is just as important. Names such as Vinayak Savarkar, Aurobindo Ghosh, Rashbehari Bose, Bagha Jatin, Sachindra Nath Sanyal, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad and Subhas Chandra Bose are still widely remembered. Their story is almost always presented as acts of individual heroism and not as part of a wider movement that had any overarching strategy or significant impact on the overall struggle for Independence. In reality, the revolutionaries were part of a large network that sustained armed resistance against the British Empire for half a century. They not only created a wide network inside India but also established nodes in Britain, France, Thailand, Germany, Persia, Russia, Italy, Ireland, the United States, Japan and Singapore. At various points, they received official support and recognition from the governments of some of these countries. Even the internal dynamics of the Indian National Congress of the time cannot be understood without the revolutionaries, who enjoyed widespread support within the organization. This was no small-scale movement of naive individual heroism but one that involved a large number of extraordinary young men and women who were connected in multiple ways to each other and to the evolving events of their times.
Revolutionaries tells their story, one that is replete with swashbuckling adventure, intrigue, espionage, incredible bravery, diabolical treachery and shockingly unpredictable twists of fate.",Sanjeev Sanyal,Books › History › World,397.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51PLOKUW6AL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062839,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/revolutionaries-the-other-story-of-how-india-won-its-freedom

1473,9344853639452,Rich Dad Poor Dad: 25th Anniversary Edition,"April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find that very little in the book itself has changed — and for good reason. While so much in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of Rich Dad Poor Dad haven’t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki’s international bestseller are more timely and more important than ever.  Milestones
While there is a milestone  to commemorate — and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important — preserving the integrity of the original content is testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents — those who embraced Robert’s story and messages 25 years ago — are sharing them with new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone’s life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances.
People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we’ve learned, and celebrate accomplishments… and they give meaning to our life’s journey. They are a way that we integrate past, present, and future… looking back at where we started, where we are today… and the promise of all that the future can hold.  In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published — 25 years since April 8, 1997 — so many things in our world have changed. But the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives, like it or not, and technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money. In an ever-changing world, we can all still get smarter when it comes to money… and learn as much as we can to secure our future.  Still the One… #1
Today Rich Dad Poor Dad consistently ranks among bestsellers around the world in the categories of Personal Finance, Parenting, and Investing, has been translated into 38 languages, and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.  In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were challenged and criticized 25 ago, are more meaningful, relevant, and important today than ever.  Rich Dad Poor Dad... • Explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to become rich • Challenges the belief that your house is an asset • Shows parents why they can't rely on the school system to teach their kids about money • Defines once and for all an asset and a liability • Teaches you what to teach your kids about money for their future financial success",Robert T.

The poetry is a companion for those who consciously enter the inner world to explore the gardens within-out of the everyday ?world of dust?-through an ascending hierarchy that restores one?s soul to the heart; the heart of the spirit; and in finding spirit, transcends all.

The stories are exuberant, earthy and bursting with vitality much like a painting by Hieronymus Bosch or Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.

1516,9344852525340,SCIENCE AND HUMANITY: A Humane Philosophy of Science and Religion,"Andrew Steane reconfigures the public understanding of science, by drawing on a deep knowledge of physics and by bringing in mainstream philosophy of science. Science is a beautiful, multi-lingual network of ideas; it is not a ladder in which ideas at one level make those at another level redundant. In view of this, we can judge that the natural world is not so much a machine as a meeting-place. In particular, people can only be correctly understood by meeting with them at the level of their entire personhood, in a reciprocal, respectful engagement as one person to another. Steane shows that Darwinian evolution does not overturn this but rather is the process whereby such truths came to be discovered and expressed in the world. From here the argument moves towards other aspects of human life. Our sense of value requires from us a response which is not altogether the same as following logical argument. This points us towards what religion in its good forms can express. A reply to a major argument of David Hume, and a related one of Richard Dawkins, is given. The book finishes with some brief chapters setting religion in the context of all human capacities, and showing, in fresh language, what theistic religious response is, or can be, in the modern world.",Andrew Steane,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,885.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41tikB01UeL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062140,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/science-and-humanity-a-humane-philosophy-of-science-and-religion

'His being is filled with Rama,' she pondered, 'but does he know me?'  Sita, the beloved princess of Mithila, is one of the most revered women in Indian history; so well known, yet probably the least understood. At every crossroad of her life, she chose acceptance and grace over self-pity. Her life was filled with sacrifice yet wherever she was, there was abundance. It was as if she was carved out of an intense longing for Rama, yet she had infinite patience. In every situation she reflected his light and he reflected her love.  In her, we find someone who is so divine yet so human.  In this poignant narration, Bhanumathi shows us the world through the eyes of Sita. We think what Sita thinks, we feel what she feels, and for these few special moments, we become a part of her. And perhaps, through this perspective, and Sita's immortal story, we will discover the true strength of a woman.",Bhanumathi Narasimhan,Books › History › Region & Countries,269.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41aK8_aUicL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994332,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/sita-a-tale-of-ancient-love-a-tale-of-ancient-love-from-indian-mythology-hindu-folklore-and-legends

Walter Isaacson tells the story of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies,music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.

He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.

1630,9344845578524,STRANGER,"The classic literary masterpiece The Stranger (Vintage International) is a story about an Algerian, Meursault, the titular character who commits a murder after attending his mothers funeral. His understanding of the world, his emotional spectrum, and the general absurdities of the time all combine to form a compelling read.
The story is aptly divided into two riveting sections, both told from the perspective of Meursault, who gives us his views before the murder in the first section and later walks us through his state of mind after the murder in the second section. The two parts in this thrilling novel encompass the protagonists mindset through the ordeal of grieving for his mothers death while also coming face to face with his own moral compass for committing a murder.
The Stranger (Vintage International) is often cited as one of the finest examples of the philosophy of the absurd. The sense of culture and various human values interwoven during the turbulent pre-modern era is also best captured in the contents of this novel. This books was published by Vintage as reissue edition in 1989 and is available in paperback.

1638,9344833454364,Summer of Then: A Novel,"A twenty-six-year-old English literature PhD student negotiates between her writing and her livelihood, her morality and her heart, her self-hood and her family’s history. Working odd jobs as a proofreader and researcher, she strays along a classically directionless path, finding herself in a stultified marriage and a similarly immobile but romantic adulterous relationship with her husband’s best friend.Summer of Then is a debut novel that relishes the interiority of women, especially about the often-unsettling intimacies of relationships―sexual, romantic and platonic―against the trauma of sexual assault and harassment. Set across Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, and even Edinburgh, Scotland, this coming-of-age novel crosses paths with the India of the 2010s, exploring the trickle-down effect of politics into academia and college life in Indian metropolitan cities, leading us just to the point of the incipient anxieties and beginnings of the 2020 pandemic.In the vein of Sally Rooney’s Normal People, Otessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation, and Avni Doshi’s Burnt Sugar, the novel’s protagonist has a sparse, yet deeply compelling voice that pays attention to precise emotional and social detail, exposing a range of motion between observational commentary and introspection.",Rupleena Bose,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,629.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41peEK4EgrL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061154,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/summer-of-then-a-novel

Ali Hazelwood, bestselling author of The Love Hypothesis From the author of the Goodreads Choice Award winner The Spanish Love Deception, the eagerly anticipated follow-up featuring Rosie Graham and Lucas Martín, who are forced to share a New York apartment. Rosie Graham has a problem. A few, actually. She just quit her well paid job to focus on her secret career as a romance writer. She hasn’t told her family and now has terrible writer’s block. Then, the ceiling of her New York apartment literally crumbles on her. Luckily she has her best friend Lina’s spare key while she’s out of town. But Rosie doesn’t know that Lina has already lent her apartment to her cousin Lucas, who Rosie has been stalking―for lack of a better word―on Instagram for the last few months. Lucas seems intent on coming to her rescue like a Spanish knight in shining armour. Only this one strolls around the place in a towel, has a distracting grin, and an irresistible accent. Oh, and he cooks. Lucas offers to let Rosie stay with him, at least until she can find some affordable temporary housing. And then he proposes an outrageous experiment to bring back her literary muse and meet her deadline: He’ll take her on a series of experimental dates meant to jump-start her romantic inspiration. Rosie has nothing to lose. Her silly, online crush is totally under control―but Lucas’s time in New York has an expiration date, and six weeks may not be enough, for either her or her deadline.

But the cool news is, you are on your own now” The fear of loneliness has been injected into our minds since we were kids. We have learned that the kid who eats, &amp; sits alone, and has no friends is pathetic. In every book/movie, the kid with no friends is always featured as a weak character who needs to be saved. No one wants to be seen as a ‘weirdo’ hence, our dread of being alone. We don’t want people to think of us as unwanted or not fitting in with the cool kids. We don’t want people to think that no one chose us. So what do we do? We start becoming like an ideal version of whom everyone loves. And in the race to achieve people’s acceptance and love, you lose yourself. But enough is enough. The book is divided into two sections. The first section is about transforming loneliness into solitude. And the second section is about using your solitude to turn it into your growth period.

It's for the crazy ones, the sane ones, those who cannot sleep at night, those who would like to be awake till midnight and beyond, those up for light reading and those up for shattering their hearts with memories all over again, for the ones crying themselves to sleep, for the ones looking for soothing words for their broken souls or for their closed ones, for the ones looking for a ray of hope, for the ones willing to let go of the past.For e-book readers, poetry lovers, poets themselves, any reader who wants to be on-board on an emotional journey of acceptance and closure.Also by the author - The Art of Grieving Poetry for the soul, 2017",Sanhita Baruah,Kindle Store › Kindle eBooks › Literature & Fiction,0.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/416evcpT6NL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715063252,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-art-of-letting-go-poetry-for-the-seekers
1697,9344837779740,The Art of Photography: A Personal Approach to Artistic Expression,"This is an updated and newly revised edition of the classic book The Art of Photography: An Approach to Personal Expression. Originally published in 1994 and first revised in 2010, The Art of Photography has sold well over 100,000 copies and has firmly established itself as the most readable, understandable, and complete textbook on photography. Featuring nearly 200 beautiful photographs in both black-and-white and color, as well as numerous charts, graphs, and tables, this book presents the world of photography to beginner, intermediate, and advanced photographers who seek to make a personal statement through the medium of photography.
Without talking down to anyone or talking over anyone's head, renowned photographer, teacher, and author Bruce Barnbaum presents how-to techniques for both traditional and digital approaches. In this newest edition of the book, Barnbaum has included many new images and has completely revised the text, with particular focus on two crucial chapters covering digital photography: he revised a chapter covering the digital zone system, and includes a brand-new chapter on image adjustments using digital tools. There is also a new chapter discussing the concepts of “art versus technique” and “traditional versus digital” approaches to photography. Throughout the book, Barnbaum goes well beyond the technical, as he delves deeply into the philosophical, expressive, and creative aspects of photography so often avoided in other books.
Barnbaum is recognized as one of the world's finest landscape and architectural photographers, and for decades has been considered one of the best instructors in the field of photography. This latest incarnation of his textbook—which has evolved, grown, and been refined over the past 45 years—will prove to be an ongoing, invaluable photographic reference for years to come. It is truly the resource of choice for the thinking photographer.Topics include:

What if someone told you that those age-old lessons on which you've based your whole life are ineffective today?
What if they also told you that you could live a better, more fulfilling life by following the path of the Asuras?
Is it not worth investigating what made the Asuras so successful against even the gods and trying to learn from them in this age of strife, chaos, and discord?
In his first nonfiction work, Anand Neelakantan, the national bestselling author of Asura: Tale of the Vanquished, explores a contrarian way of living that makes more sense in this Kali Yuga.
With great skill and logic, Anand shatters the myths associated with the so-called six enemies of the mind-anger, passion, greed, infatuation, pride, and competitive spirit.
He explains how following conventional advice holds you back from achieving success and happiness in life.

1722,9344873201948,The Big Book of Science Fiction: The Ultimate Collection,"Since the days of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, science fiction has not just helped shape more than a century of literature, but has reached well beyond fictional realms to influence our perspectives on culture, science and technology. Ideas like electric cars, space travel and forms of advanced communication comparable to today's cell phone all first found their way into the public's awareness through science fiction. While entertaining us, science fiction has allowed us to dream of a better world by creating visions of future societies without prejudice or war. Dystopias, too, like Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, have allowed writers to comment on injustice and dangers to democracy. Today, science fiction continues to ask ""what if?"" about such important topics as global warming, energy dependence and the uses of our modern technology. No other form of literature has been so relevant to our present yet been so filled with visionary and transcendent moments. Until now there has been no definitive and complete collection that truly captured the global influence and significance of this dynamic genre. Encompassing hard science fiction, soft (social) science fiction, space opera, alternative history, apocalyptic stories, tales of alien encounters, near-future dystopia, far-future myths and a host of other modes, 'The Big Book of Science Fiction' brings together authors from all over the world and from both the genre and literary ends of the spectrum.

Moushumi Kandali makes a similar attempt in The Black Magic Women, but with a stark difference. She brings her characters out of Assam and places them in the mainstream, capturing their struggle to retain their inherent 'Assameseness' as they try to assimilate into the larger society.The stories makes one pause, think and debate issues that range from racial discrimination ('The Fireflies Outside of the Frame') to sexual harassment ('The Hyenas and Coach Number One', 'Kalindi, Your Black Waters . . . ') to the existential and ideological dilemma induced by the state's complex sociopolitical scenario ('The Final Leap of the Salmon'). The title story is revealing of how mainstream India perceives Assamese women-as powered with the art of seduction and black magic-as a result of which they face social discrimination that can range from racial slurs to physical abuse.The writer ventures into a surrealistic mode, using a generous sprinkle of fable, myth and metaphors to deliver a powerful punch.

Banger and Mash knew something strange was happening when their peoples’ scent began to fade. Sweetpea the cat knew it too, but…you know…he just wasn’t that worried about it. But when their human vanishes into thin air right before their noses, they race to get help from the other dogs in the village, only to discover that EVERYONE'S humans have disappeared.
Banger, a rescue with a traumatic past, convinces the other dogs that they must have done something Very Bad to incur this terrible punishment. Determined to become Perfect Dogs to entice the humans to return, a draconian system of laws is put into place to keep dogs from doing anything that might be seen as Bad—no more eating trash, no more sleeping on the couch, and definitely no humping. Sweetpea is more than happy to use his prodigious feline memory to help them keep track of their ever-more-complicated rules…so long as they refer to him as His Masterfulness, and pay him homage.
Mash, on the other hand, is not so sure that they’re going about it the right way. He wants to be a Good Dog, but he’s pretty sure that the whole reason the peoples loved them in the first place was because they were…well…dogs.As differing philosophies give rise to conflict amongst the canines, a new theory of how they should behave arises from an unlikely source: Sweetpea--AKA, His Masterfulness--who is either the only cat capable of hearing the voice of the peoples…or maybe he’s just going crazy.Satire and metaphysics come together in this humorous and often heartwarming tale about our four-legged friends, and how love conquers all.",D.J.

In The Book of Ichigo Ichie, you will learn to use all five senses to anchor yourself in the present. Every one of us contains a key that can open the door to attention, harmony with others, and love of life. And that key is ichigo ichie.'This is a great little book to lift the spirits and remind us of the importance of living in the 'now', not worrying about the past or future.' - 5* Reader Review'This book should act as a wakeup call.

The bestselling historical fiction novel from Kim Michele Richardson, this is a novel following Cussy Mary, a packhorse librarian and her quest to bring books to the Appalachian community she loves, perfect for readers of William Kent Kreuger and Lisa Wingate. The perfect addition to your next book club!
The hardscrabble folks of Troublesome Creek have to scrap for everything―everything except books, that is. Thanks to Roosevelt's Kentucky Pack Horse Library Project, Troublesome's got its very own traveling librarian, Cussy Mary Carter.
Cussy's not only a book woman, however, she's also the last of her kind, her skin a shade of blue unlike most anyone else. Not everyone is keen on Cussy's family or the Library Project, and a Blue is often blamed for any whiff of trouble. If Cussy wants to bring the joy of books to the hill folks, she's going to have to confront prejudice as old as the Appalachias and suspicion as deep as the holler.
Inspired by the true blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the brave and dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse library service of the 1930s, The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek is a story of raw courage, fierce strength, and one woman's belief that books can carry us anywhere―even back home.

1781,9344805437724,The Cooking of Books : A Literary Memoir,"It is not often that an author and his editor strike up a relationship that survives forty years of epistolary exchanges and intellectual sparring. The strangely enduring and occasionally fractious friendship that developed between the famously outspoken historian Ramachandra Guha and his reticent editor Rukun Advani is the subject of this quite eccentric and thoroughly compelling literary memoir.
It started in Delhi in the early 1980s, when Guha was an unpublished PhD scholar, and Advani a greenhorn editor with the Oxford University Press. It blossomed through the 1990s,when Guha grew into a pioneering historian of the environment and of cricket, while also writing his pathbreaking biography of Verrier Elwin. Over these years, Advani was Guha’s most constant confidant, his most reliable reader. He encouraged him to craft and refine the literary style for which Guha became internationally known – narrative histories that have made vast areas of scholarship popular and accessible.
Four decades later, though he no longer publishes his books,Advani remains Guha’s most trusted literary adviser. Yet they also disagree ferociously on politics, human nature, and the nature of their commitment to India. They usually make up – because it just wouldn’t do to allow such an odd relationship to die.
Built around letters and emails between an outgoing and occasionally combative scholar and a reclusive editor prone to private outbursts of savage sarcasm, this book is never short of the kind of wit, humour, and drollery that has been strangled by contemporary political correctness.",Ramachandra Guha,"Books › Biographies, Diaries & True Accounts › Biographies & Autobiographies",440.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41JiWAaIw9L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715059671,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-cooking-of-books-a-literary-memoir

While grappling with the question of how to live with purpose and find meaning in the journey, these poems offer both honest explorations of loneliness and our search for connection, as well as light-hearted, humorous observations. As Atticus writes poignantly about dancing, Paris, jazz clubs, sunsets, sharing a bottle of wine on the river, rainy days, creating, and destroying, he illustrates that we need moments of both beauty and pain = the darkness and the stars = to fully appreciate all that life and love have to offer.",Atticus Poetry,Books › Literature & Fiction › Poetry,484.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51tp6PbwkOL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715063016,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-dark-between-stars

1796,9343457853724,The Diary of A Young Girl [Paperback] Anne Frank,"An Inspiration The Holocaust was one of the most horrendous and terrible eras in history. Innumerable books have been written describing the horrors of the Holocaust; but nothing beats the documentation of a family who had gone into hiding in the diary of a little girl, Anne Frank. Honest, lucid and empathetic; The Diary of A Young Girl deserves a read by everyone who has ever questioned mental strength of humans and also by those who cannot come to terms with the cruelties that could be inflicted by humans upon fellow humans. The first entry in the diary is on June 12, 1942 by Anne Frank, who had received it as a birthday present and the entries in the diary end abruptly on 1 August, 1944. The Underlying Themes Anne Frank and her family lived a peaceful life in Frankfurt, Germany but they had to escape to Amsterdam with fellow Jews and go into hiding, as the Nazis took over Europe. Anne writes in her diary the tribulations her family had to face living in hiding, because they knew if caught, they would have to suffer horribly. The sufferance of the Jews during the Holocaust is known to all; yet a thirteen year old feeling the impact of intolerance and racism makes readers realise how profound the impacts of the World War II was. What is most captivating is that amidst the terror and the fear, Anne manages to remain a cheerful girl full of life, who loved to talk and observe. Still a teenager and unaware of the horrors lurking behind their hiding space, Anne fails to realise the fear trapped within the hearts of elders initially and describes everyday events from the view of a teenager. As the story develops, Anne develops and realisation comes over her. The Nazis are getting more stringent and oppression rises; there are certain places in the book that leaves readers sad and distressed.

AN UNFORGETTABLE TALE OF LOVE, AMBITION, RIVALRY AND FATE PLAYS OUT IN AN EPIC CLASH OF THRONES.
WINNER OF THE SAHITYA AKADEMI AWARD
The English translation of the bestselling Assamese novel Deo Langkhui. The unexpected demise of Prince Mriganko of Gobha, orchestrated by his rival, King Jokanko, has sent shockwaves of sorrow rippling not only through his grieving parents but also the entire kingdom. Then, in a surprising twist, Jokanko voluntarily surrenders himself. Abi Konsari, the custodian of the threads of the past, must now unravel the sequence of events that led to this tragic fate, even as long-buried truths about bloodlines and tumultuous histories come to light.
At the heart of Gobha lies a story of power and prophecy. Years earlier, the young and radiant Queen Chandraprabha was banished by her husband for supposedly nurturing an amorous desire. In a foreign land she later transformed into Konsari. Despite her efforts to start anew, her son Mriganko became ensnared in a ceaseless cycle of ambition and greed, navigating perilous landscapes marked by rival kings and their malevolent schemes. Now, burdened by his mother’s curse and armed with the truth, Jokanko must alter his destiny, wielding a divine sword that can bestow boundless might upon its owner. As dynasties clash and kingdoms crumble, an intense battle ensues among men hungry for the sword’s limitless power. All the while, the wheels of destiny continue to turn inexorably ...

Unlike other great religions that are based on a small set of books, there are hundreds of texts in Hinduism, most of which are very voluminous. They span not merely centuries, but millennia. And most importantly, these ancient scriptures are all in Sanskrit which many do not know. Therefore for a beginner with an interest in Hinduism it is a daunting task as you don't know where to start such a study. In The Essentials of Hinduism, Trilochan Sastry unpacks all the ancient texts from the Vedas to the epics covering the entire range of scriptures and everything you need to know about them in an easy-to-read and accessible way making it of special interest to Hindus and those from other religions and nations, and even those who are agnostic or atheistic.",Trilochan Sastry,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,349.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/614ILvunINL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062013,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-essentials-of-hinduism-an-introduction-to-all-the-sacred-texts

1817,9344828604700,The Eye of History: When Images Take Positions (RIC BOOKS (Ryerson Image Centre Books)),"An exploration of the interaction of aesthetics and politics in Bertolt Brecht's “photoepigrams.”From 1938 to 1955, Bertolt Brecht created montages of images and text, filling his working journal (Arbeitsjournal) and his idiosyncratic atlas of images, War Primer, with war photographs clipped from magazines and adding his own epigrammatic commentary. In this book, Georges Didi-Huberman explores the interaction of politics and aesthetics in these creations, explaining how they became the means for Brecht, a wandering poet in exile, to “take a position” about the Nazi war in Europe. Illustrated with pages from the Arbeitsjournal and War Primer and contextual images including Raoul Hausmann's poem-posters and Walter Benjamin's drawings, The Eye of History offers a new view of important but little-known works by Brecht.Didi-Huberman shows that Brecht took positions without taking sides; he used these montages to challenge the viewpoints of the press and propose other readings, to offer a stylistic and political response to the inescapable visibility of historical events enabled by the photographic medium. Brecht's montages disrupt and scrutinize this visibility by juxtaposing representations of war found in magazines with his own epigrams—a “documentary lyricism” that dismounts and remounts modern history. The montages created meaningful disorder, exposing the truth by disorganizing—a process Didi-Huberman calls a “dialectic of the monteur.” These works are examples of “the eyes of history”—when seeing may simultaneously deepen and critique historical knowledge. The montages Didi-Huberman argues, are Brecht's most Benjaminian works.

Years before, she ran away from her husband and son without explanation or any further contact, only to die alone in an apartment far away, leaving her estranged son with many unanswered questions. Now in Tokyo, Michiko Oshitani is found dead many miles from home. Strangled to death, left in the bare apartment rented under a false name by a man who has disappeared without a trace. Oshitani lived far away in Sendai, with no known connection to Tokyo - and neither her family nor friends have any idea why she would have gone there. Hers is the second strangulation death in that approximate area of Tokyo - the other was a homeless man, killed and his body burned in a tent by the river. As the police search through Oshitani's past for any clue that might shed some light, one of the detectives reaches out to Detective Kaga for advice.

1848,9344838828316,The Greatest Malayalam Stories Ever Told,"The Greatest Malayalam Stories Ever Told is a collection of fifty brilliant short stories translated from the Malayalam. Selected and translated by poet, editor, and translator A. J. Thomas, this collection includes established masters such as Karoor Neelakanta Pillai, Vaikom Muhammad Basheer, Lalithambika Antharjanam, Ponkunnam Varkey, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, S. K. Pottekkatt, Uroob, O. V. Vijayan, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, and Paul Zacharia, as well as accomplished new voices such as N. Prabhakaran, C. V. Balakrishnan, Aymanam John, Chandramathi, and others.
'The Farmer' by Thakazhi and 'The Speaking Plough' by Varkey deal with the trials and tribulations of village life. In Pilllai's story 'Wooden Dolls' and Kesadeva's 'The Oath', we encounter the seemingly simple, but intrinsically complex personalities of three rural women characters. In his classic story 'The World-renowned Nose', Basheer, the master satirist, resorts to biting satire to expose human vanity. In Antharjanam's 'Dhirendu Majumdar's Mother', the mother emerges as the revolutionary heroine of the Partition of 1947 and the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. 'Humans and Animals' by Nandanar narrates an unbelievably macabre incident from the horrors of Partition. In O. V. Vijayan's masterpiece, 'The Hanging', the reader is drawn into a father's sorrow over the death of his child. Madhavikkuty in 'Scent of a Bird' draws in bold strokes the existential angst of a modern woman who wishes to make a career for herself. P. Vatsala's story 'Pempi' describes the plight of Adiyar tribal women. M. T. Vasudevan Nair, in his celebrated story, 'Vision', underlines the freedom and liberated state of women choosing for themselves. 'Photo' by M. Mukundan is a harrowing story about child molestation. Zacharia, in his inimitable style, tells the story of an eccentric and reclusive masseur-physician who is challenged by a patient to heal her in 'The Garden of the Antlions'. Sara Joseph's 'Sweat Marks' shows how caste elites come together to dupe a brilliant Dalit student.

1893,9344851575068,The Journey of Advaita: From the Rgveda to Sri Aurobindo (Contemporary Researches in Hindu Philosophy and Religion Book 19),"About the BookThe Journey of Advaita elucidates the richness, depth and profundity of Advaitic thought right from Vedas to Integral Advaitism of Sri Aurobindo and further how it is being incorporated in modern science.Advaita Philosophy is not a later development of thought as one of the six systems of Indian philosophy. Vedas are replete with suggestions about Unity. The earlier stage of naturalistic and anthropomorphic polytheism yielded to monistic belief. In the dictum, ekam sad viprā bahudhā vadanti we perceive an echo of Unity. Upaniṣadic seers picked up this Unity and tirelessly went in their search till they came to the highest conclusion, tat tvam asi.This concept of Unity gets its full bloom in Śaṅkara’s Kevalādvaita; later on it gave inspiration to different rivulets of Vedānta schools. Śaṅkara’s unqualified impersonal Brahman could not satisfy those who sought loving communion with God. Consequently different schools of Bhakti-Vedānta came into existence, namely, Viśiṣṭādvaita of Rāmānuja, Dvaita of Madhva, Dvaitādvaita of Nimbārka and Śuddhādvaita of Vallabha. For all of them the emphasis is on the liberation of individual soul only, which gave way to Sri Aurobindo’s Integral Advaitism where the emphasis is not only on spiritualization of man but of the whole cosmos.The journey continues further with modern physics. Consciousness is the building block of the Universe and the ground of all beings, which can’t be found in plural.About the AuthorDr Priti Sinha retired as the Head, Department of Philosophy, Vasanta College, Banaras Hindu University after twenty-eight years of service.

1897,9344857997596,The Kashmir Conundrum: The Quest for Peace in a Troubled Land,"Kashmir has been considered one of the longest-running and most intractable conflicts of the modern world. How does one make sense of the issue and look to the future?
In The Kashmir Conundrum, former Indian Army chief General N.C. Vij – who himself hails from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir – gives the complete picture. Starting with a history of Kashmir and its people, he covers the invasion and accession of the kingdom, the wars India and Pakistan have fought, the Pulwama attack of 2019, India's surgical strike at Balakot, and the various formulae that have been tried to settle the issue, right up to the controversial abrogation of the state's special status. In doing so, he draws on his own experience of dealing with the subject closely – as DGMO during the Kargil war; as vice chief of the army during the Parliament attack of 2001; and then as the chief at a time when Pakistan-sponsored infiltration was at its peak.
Informed by a field expert's astute perspective, this is a comprehensive and up-to-date account of Kashmir from an army man who has engaged with it at the highest levels.",General N.C.

This book will shock, surprise, and grip you. You will never think of the Mahabharata the same way again.  Most people believe that the Khandavaprastha forest was burned down to build Indraprastha. But this belief is wrong. According to the Mahabharata, Indraprastha was built before Khandavaprastha forest was destroyed and only seven creatures survived the massacre and conflagration.

Can history and science provide an explanation?  Find out in The Khandavaprastha Conspiracy, Book 3 of The Mahabharata Quest series, where science meets the Mahabharata in an explosive mix of action, adventure, suspense and mystery.  3340 BCE: A deadly scourge ravages a village in China, forcing a handful of survivors to abandon their homes.  1800 CE: A wounded monkey, rescued from the Amazon Forest, miraculously grows back the missing part of a leg ... and then rips itself apart.  PRESENT DAY: A devastating and terrifying disease is spreading fast across the globe, leaving scientists helpless and baffled. The human immune system cannot detect this pathogen ... nor can any test thus far known to science. Vijay and the Global Task Force, headed by Director Patterson, find trail of clues that leads them to a mystery buried deep in the Mahabharata and a chilling conspiracy with catastrophic consequences.  As the fate of the world hangs in the balance, they must race against time to solve a mystifying riddle and unravel the deadly enigma that threatens to annihilate the human race.

1991,9344869007644,The Penguin Book of Russian Poetry (Penguin Classics),"An enchanting collection of the very best of Russian poetry, edited by acclaimed translator Robert Chandler together with poets Boris Dralyuk and Irina Mashinski. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, poetry's pre-eminence in Russia was unchallenged, with Pushkin and his contemporaries ushering in the 'Golden Age' of Russian literature. Prose briefly gained the high ground in the second half of the nineteenth century, but poetry again became dominant in the 'Silver Age' (the early twentieth century), when belief in reason and progress yielded once more to a more magical view of the world. During the Soviet era, poetry became a dangerous, subversive activity; nevertheless, poets such as Osip Mandelstam and Anna Akhmatova continued to defy the censors. This anthology traces Russian poetry from its Golden Age to the modern era, including work by several great poets - Georgy Ivanov and Varlam Shalamov among them - in captivating modern translations by Robert Chandler and others. The volume also includes a general introduction, chronology and individual introductions to each poet. Robert Chandler is an acclaimed poet and translator. His many translations from Russian include works by Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolay Leskov, Vasily Grossman and Andrey Platonov, while his anthologies of Russian Short Stories from Pushkin to Buida and Russian Magic Tales are both published in Penguin Classics.Irina Mashinski is a bilingual poet and co-founder of the StoSvet literary project. Her most recent collection is 2013's Ophelia i masterok [Ophelia and the Trowel].Boris Dralyuk is a Lecturer in Russian at the University of St Andrews and translator of many books from Russian, including, most recently, Isaac Babel's Red Cavalry (2014).",Robert Chandler,Kindle Store › Kindle eBooks › Literature & Fiction,309.30,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51aPrCZ9pJL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062982,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-penguin-book-of-russian-poetry-penguin-classics

The book consists of a series of detailed discussions of the key concepts used by Patanjali in his Yoga-Sutra to describe and explain the enigma of human existence and to point a way beyond the perpetual motion of the wheel of becoming. Feuerstein's study differs from previous ones in that it seeks to free Patanjali's aphoristic statements from the accretions of later interpretations; instead, the author places the Sutra in its original context and sees it as the source of the whole edifice of classical yoga and not just as a summary of previous developments.

‘The best fantasy debut of 2018’ WIRED
A brilliantly imaginative epic fantasy debut, inspired by the bloody history of China’s twentieth century and filled with treachery and magic.
When Rin aced the Keju – the test to find the most talented students in the Empire – it was a shock to everyone: to the test officials, who couldn’t believe a war orphan from Rooster Province could pass without cheating; to Rin’s guardians, who had hoped to get rich by marrying her off; and to Rin herself, who realized she was finally free from a life of servitude. That she got into Sinegard – the most elite military school in Nikan – was even more surprising.
But surprises aren’t always good.
Because being a dark-skinned peasant girl from the south is not an easy thing at Sinegard. Fighting the prejudice of rival classmates, Rin discovers that she possesses a lethal, unearthly power – an aptitude for the nearly-mythical art of shamanism. Exploring the depths of her gift with the help of psychoactive substances and a seemingly insane teacher, Rin learns that gods long thought dead are very much alive – and that mastering these powers could mean more than just surviving school.
For while the Nikara Empire is at peace, the Federation of Mugen still lurks across a narrow sea. The Federation occupied Nikan for decades after the First Poppy War, and only barely lost the continent in the Second. And while most people calmly go about their lives, a few are aware that a Third Poppy War is just a spark away…",R.F.

Erika Johansen’s debut novel is a genre mashup: medieval fantasy meets dystopian future. . . . An addictive and enjoyable adventure. . . . The Tear is just as easy to get sucked into as Westeros or Hogwarts or Panem.” —USA Today
Magic, adventure, mystery, and romance combine in this epic debut in which a young princess must reclaim her dead mother’s throne, learn to be a ruler—and defeat the Red Queen, a powerful and malevolent sorceress determined to destroy her.
On her nineteenth birthday, Princess Kelsea Raleigh Glynn, raised in exile, sets out on a perilous journey back to the castle of her birth to ascend her rightful throne. Plain and serious, a girl who loves books and learning, Kelsea bears little resemblance to her mother, the vain and frivolous Queen Elyssa. But though she may be inexperienced and sheltered, Kelsea is not defenseless: Around her neck hangs the Tearling sapphire, a jewel of immense magical power; and accompanying her is the Queen’s Guard, a cadre of brave knights led by the enigmatic and dedicated Lazarus. Kelsea will need them all to survive a cabal of enemies who will use every weapon—from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic—to prevent her from wearing the crown.
Despite her royal blood, Kelsea feels like nothing so much as an insecure girl, a child called upon to lead a people and a kingdom about which she knows almost nothing. But what she discovers in the capital will change everything, confronting her with horrors she never imagined. An act of singular daring will throw Kelsea’s kingdom into tumult, unleashing the vengeance of the tyrannical ruler of neighboring Mortmesne: the Red Queen, a sorceress possessed of the darkest magic. Now Kelsea will begin to discover whom among the servants, aristocracy, and her own guard she can trust.
But the quest to save her kingdom and meet her destiny has only just begun—a wondrous journey of self-discovery and a trial by fire that will make her a legend . . . if she can survive.",Erika Johansen,"Kindle Store › Kindle eBooks › Fantasy, Horror & Science Fiction",0.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51e0p3EDIWL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994611,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-queen-of-the-tearling-preview-edition-e-book-queen-of-the-tearling-the-1

The new essential self-healing bible – a revolutionary body-first guide to regulating your nervous system, curing long-term pain and healing from trauma for good.
Anxious, burnt out, tired, overthinking, angry, shutting down, disassociating, procrastinating, people-pleasing, physical pain, chronic unexplained symptoms. If you’re stuck, we can help.
Many of us have heard of nervous system dysregulation – but what does it actually mean, and what can we do about it? The Secret Language of the Body is your essential guide for moving out of survival mode, and healing your mind and body.
When a person is burdened by stress, anxiety and trauma, their nervous system adapts to help keep them alive in the short term, but can trap them in survival mode long-term, with detrimental effects. This is the state of nervous system dysregulation. Our autonomic nervous system is responsible for the constant yet subconscious communication between our brain and body, using a secret language that we urgently need to understand. Mind and body practitioners Jennifer Mann and Karden Rabin outline the three essential steps for resolving nervous system dysregulation:
Become aware of dysregulated body response and why they happen
Become aware of dysregulated body response and why they happen
Interrupt these responses

2072,9343204196636,The Sixteen Satires: Revised Edition (Penguin Classics),"Perhaps more than any other writer, Juvenal (c. AD 55-138) captures the splendour, the squalor and the sheer energy of everyday Roman life. In The Sixteen Satires he evokes a fascinating world of whores, fortune-tellers, boozy politicians, slick lawyers, shameless sycophants, ageing flirts and downtrodden teachers. A member of the traditional land-owning class that was rapidly seeing power slip into the hands of outsiders, Juvenal also creates savage portraits of decadent aristocrats - male and female - seeking excitement among the lower orders of actors and gladiators, and of the jumped-up sons of newly-rich former slaves. Constantly comparing the corruption of his own generation with its stern and upright forebears, Juvenal's powers of irony and invective make his work a stunningly satirical and bitter denunciation of the degeneracy of Roman society",Juvenal,Books › Literature & Fiction › Classic Fiction,436.69,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51ADi5ZDJ_L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714993718,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-sixteen-satires-revised-edition-penguin-classics

2083,9344812450076,The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck : A Counterintuitive Approach To Living A Good Life,"In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be positive all the time so that we can truly become better, happier peopleFor decades, weve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. Fuck positivity, Mark Manson says. Lets be honest, shit is fucked and we have to live with it. In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesnt sugar-coat or equivocate. He tells it like it isa dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, lets-all-feel-good mind-set that has infectedAmerican society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limitednot everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society and some of it is not fair or your fault. Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embraceour fears, faults and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity and forgiveness we seek.There are only so many things we can give a fuck about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience.A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in the-eye moment of real talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them truly lead contented, grounded lives.",Mark Manson,"Books › Health, Family & Personal Development › Self-Help",385.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/511vJPN7p5L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715060016,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck-a-counterintuitive-approach-to-living-a-good-life

If John D. Rockefeller was creating unimagined wealth in the US that he would put to the service of the nation, a Parsi family with humble roots was doing the same in India. In 1822, a boy was born in a priestly household in Gujarat's Navsari. Young Nusserwanji knew early on that his destiny lay beyond his village and decided to head for Bombay to start a business. What Nusserwanji started as a cotton trading venture, his son Jamsetji, born in the same year as Rockefeller, grew into a multifaceted business, turning around sick textile mills, setting up an iron and steel company, envisioning a cutting-edge institute of higher learning, building a world-class hotel. Stewarded ably over the decades by Jamsetji's sons Dorabji and Ratanji, the larger-than-life JRD, and thereafter the more business-like Ratan, the Tata group is a 110-billion-dollar empire.

The tender feelgood story of a man's journey around Japan with a streetcat. Translated by Philip Gabriel, a translator of Murakami.
It's not the journey that counts, but who's at your side.  Nana is on a road trip, but he is not sure where he is going. All that matters is that he can sit beside his beloved owner Satoru in the front seat of his silver van. Satoru is keen to visit three old friends from his youth, though Nana doesn’t know why and Satoru won’t say.   Set against the backdrop of Japan’s changing seasons and narrated with a rare gentleness and humour, Nana’s story explores the wonder and thrill of life’s unexpected detours. It is about the value of friendship and solitude, and knowing when to give and when to take. TRAVELLING CAT has already demonstrated its power to move thousands with a message of kindness and truth. It shows, above all, how acts of love, both great and small, can transform our lives.

2102,9343359222044,THE TRUE TALL TALE OF A GIANTESS: THE STORY OF ANNA SWAN,"?When I was small, I was already big news,? Anna Swan tells readers in this picture book biography. When she was born in Nova Scotia in 1846, people for miles around chattered about her. They whispered over tea and gossiped across fences. Because even when she was small, Anna was TREMENDOUS. At four years old, she was higher than a rain barrel. At six, she was taller than her mother, and by ten she towered over her father. Anna grew up feeling like she poked and bulged and jutted out from all sorts of spaces, never quite fitting into her small country life. Then, at age seventeen, Anna moved to New York City to be part of P. T. Barnum's Gallery of Wonders --- and her life changed forever. Anna Swan lived an inspiring life as big as she was, filled with fame, wealth, world travel and true love. In this thoroughly researched picture book biography, Anne Renaud uses playful and rhythmic language and first-person storytelling to perfectly capture the essence of this unique woman's uplifting life. The detailed, folk art-inspired illustrations beautifully convey the story's time and place and sensitively portray Anna's growth. A great lead-in for classroom discussions about differences and inclusion, this book also offers an excellent character education lesson on perseverance.

A 'narrative' may not necessarily be based on truth, but it does need to be plausible, have a meaning and create a desired perception.

For Arthur Dent, who has only just had his house demolished that morning, this seems already to be rather a lot to cope with. Sadly, however, the weekend has only just begun. The Galaxy may offer a mind-boggling variety of ways to be blown up and/or insulted, but it’s very hard to get a cup of tea. The Restaurant at the End of the UniverseWhen all questions of space, time, matter and the nature of being have been resolved, only one question remains - 'Where shall we have dinner?' The Restaurant at the End of the Universe provides the ultimate gastronomic experience, and for once there is no morning after to worry about.Life, the Universe and EverythingFollowing a number of stunning catastrophes, Arthur Dent is surprised to find himself living in a hideously miserable cave on prehistoric Earth. However, just as he thinks that things cannot get possibly worse, they suddenly do. An eddy in the space-time continuum lands him, Ford Prefect, and their flying sofa in the middle of the cricket ground at Lord's, just two days before the world is due to be destroyed by the Vogons. Escaping the end of the world for a second time, Arthur, Ford, and their old friend Slartibartfast embark (reluctantly) on a mission to save the whole galaxy from fanatical robots. Not bad for a man in his dressing gown.So Long, and Thanks for All the FishThere is a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. It's not an easy thing to do, and Arthur Dent thinks he's the only human who's been able to master this nifty little trick - until he meets Fenchurch, the woman of his dreams. Fenchurch once realised how the world could be made a good and happy place. Unfortunately, she's forgotten. Convinced that the secret lies within God's Final Message to His Creation, they go in search of it. And, in a dramatic break with tradition, actually find it . . .Mostly HarmlessArthur Dent has settled down on the small planet Lamuella and has embraced his role as a Sandwich Maker. However, his plans for a quiet life are thrown awry by the unexpected arrival of his daughter. There's nothing worse than a frustrated teenager with a copy of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy in their hands. When she runs away, Arthur goes after her determined to save her from the horrors of the universe.

2112,9343524372764,The Unmaking Of India Chronicles [Paperback] Nayantara Sahgal,"When the Moon Shines By Day is about a troubled time in India—the present. Rehana finds her father’s books on medieval history have ‘disappeared’ from bookstores and libraries. Her young servant, Abdul, discovers it is safer to be called Morari Lal in the street. There is no such protection from vigilante fury for his Dalit friend, Suraj.Kamlesh, a diplomat and writer comes up against official wrath for his anti-war views.Presiding over this changing India is the Director of Cultural Transformation whose smiling affability masks a relentless agenda to create a Hindu master race.
A fitting sequel to the first novel, The Fate of Butterflies tells the story of Prabhakar,who, returning home one evening, comes upon a corpse at a crossroads, naked but for the skullcap on his head. Days later, he listens to Katerina’s stark retelling of a gang rape in a village, as chilling as only the account of a victim can be. And in a macabre sequence, he finds his favourite dhaba no longer serves gular kebabs and rumali roti, while Bonjour, the fine dining restaurant run by a gay couple, has been vandalised by goons.
Casting a long shadow over it all is Mirajkar, the ‘Master Mind’, brilliant policy maker and political theorist, who is determined to rid the country of all elements alien to its culture – as he, and his partymen, perceive it.
In these two brilliant satires, Nayantara Sahgal draws a telling portrait of our times.",Nayantara Sahgal,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,394.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41H50RFjFuL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714995188,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/the-unmaking-of-india-chronicles-paperback-nayantara-sahgal

2131,9343565365532,The Women's Room: A Novel,"The twenty-one-million copy bestselling novel and provocative feminist classic that changed the world when it was first published in 1977 “With The Women’s Room, Marilyn French joined Simone de Beauvoir, Ralph Ellison, and that very small group of writers whose words spark a movement.” —Gloria Steinem In the 1950s, many American women left education and professional advancement behind in order to marry, only to find themselves adrift and unable to support themselves after divorcing their husbands twenty years later. Some became destitute; a few went insane. But many went back to school in the heyday of the Women’s Liberation movement, and were swept up in the promise of equality for both sexes. The Women’s Room tells the story of one such woman: a suburban 1950s housewife named Mira who divorces her loathsome husband and returns to graduate school at Harvard. Loosely based on Marilyn French’s own life, the story of Mira and her friends offers wry, piercing insight into the inner lives of a generation of American women. A powerful indictment of the patriarchal social norms of the time, it caused an uproar when it was first published in 1977, changing the course of the feminist movement forever.

2143,9344838172956,These Errors Are Correct,"A meditation on grief, These Errors are Correct is Jeet Thayil's most intimate work to date. In poems of tenderness and rage, time blurs into a continuous present visited by Billy the Kid, the Buddha, Lata Mangeshkar, Jesus and Beethoven, by unnamed protagonists for whom faith and addiction are interchangeable, and by a remote god-like figure who will 'lick / your wound with his infected tongue'.

2158,9343212323100,Three Satires from Ancient Kashmir Kshemendra and A.N.D.Haksar,"Three Satires From Ancient Kashmir is a compilation of three satires that were written by a Sanskrit scholar in the eleventh century with these tales originating from ancient Kashmir. These satires are aimed at the prevalent moral bankruptcy in ancient Kashmir then and are of relevance even today with the greed for wealth and power that is so common everywhere.
The book comprises three satirical bhanas or 'causeries', which are 'Narma Mala' or 'A Garland of Mirth', 'Kala Vilasa' or 'A Dalliance With Deceptions,' and 'Deshopedesha' or 'Advice From the Countryside.' the fables themselves are of little significance, but what is important is the detailing in the work by the author that cuts deeply inside the social structure of that period in time. The translation indeed does justification to the original language in which it was penned. The chapters also contain dry humour like when the author writes about the foreign student, for whom 'even a river is considered insufficient for his purificatory rites.'
The work does not spare anyone, neither a buddhist nun nor the poets themselves. The author condemns working wives and women who party as 'demons of a thousand deceptions in the dark night of this degenerate age.' He is especially harsh on cheating officials and traders in the Three Satires From Ancient Kashmir. His work is never far from its inherent wit and cynicism. The book was published by Penguin India in 2011 and is available as a paperback.
Key Features:
This is a major work in Sanskrit written by a scholar from Kashmir in the eleventh century whose 18 works have been discovered thus far.

Sudha Murty-through the exceptional work of the Infosys Foundation as well as through her own youth, family life and travels-encounters many such stories... And she tells them here in her characteristically clear-eyed, warm-hearted way. She talks candidly about the meaningful impact of her work in the devadasi community, her trials and tribulations as the only female student in her engineering college and the unexpected and inspiring consequences of her father's kindness.

2182,9343403917596,TOWARDS A NATIONALIST NARRATIVE OF INDIA’S ANCIENT PAST: Including Recent Research on the Indus Civilization,"In 1966 the famous Indian parliamentarian Ram Manohar Lohia regretted in Parliament that the minds of our children were ingrained with the belief that “India had nothing of its own; everything was either imitated or influenced by outside factors”. He called the Indian historiography ‘diseased’. His opinion was echoed by M.C. Chagla, the education minister, who advocated the idea of re-writing Indian history. Taking Dr. Lohia’s opinion as the starting point, the present volume goes on to argue that post-Independence Indian archaeologists, despite making many new discoveries, have been most unashamedly neocolonial without the least awareness of the interrelationship between archaeological data and nationalism. The volume deals with multiple aspects of this interrelationship and undertakes a critical review of the recent research on the Indus civilization, showing that the very idea of the integrity and homogeneity of this civilization, which is the fountainhead of India’s mainstream civilization, is being currently undermined by both Indian and foreign archaeologists who consider it only a veneer on top of the regional elements.Finally, the volume argues that the geographical and chronological implications of some recent discoveries conclusively underline that India’s protohistoric archaeological column and the literary column represented by the Vedic literature are inseparably linked, thus forming the first block of the seamless narrative of India’s ancient past.Dilip K. Chakrabarti (1941) is emeritus professor of south Asian archaeology at Cambridge University. He was awarded Padma Shri in 2019. In 2021 he received a ‘life-time achievement’ award from the UK Bengali Convention (UKBC).",Dilip K Chakrabarti,Books › History › Indian History,0.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51pppQrOslL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994647,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/towards-a-nationalist-narrative-of-india-s-ancient-past-including-recent-research-on-the-indus-civilization

2184,9343555240220,Train To Pakistan (PB),"The partition of India was one of the most dreadful times in the recent Indian history. Since 1950s, it has time and again been depicted in various media. However, while most of those focussed mainly on the socio-political causes and effects, the Train to Pakistan is a novel which has captured the essential human trauma and suffering in the face of such a terror and crisis.
The novel commences with a description of Mano Majra, a little village with Muslim and Sikh population that suddenly becomes a part of the border between Indian and Pakistan. An idyllic and peaceful village, Mano Majra resorted to love and harmony even at the face of all odds till external forces come and disrupted all the harmony.
The odds start when a train filled with dead bodies of Sikhs and Hindus arrive in Mano Majra. Riots and strikes reached a high with the Sikhs and Hindus being on one side and the Muslims on the other. Torn between them and their vested interests are two peopleJuggut and Iqbal, the former being a criminal and the latter being a western educated fellow on a mission to reform the society. Also underlying it is a love story that transcends all religion and odds.
Regarded as one of the most heart-rending testimonials of the partition of 1947, the Train to Pakistan is an ideal novel for those who wishes to learn more about Indias past and is looking for more than the socio-political scenario behind the partition.

And we finish with a look at alternatives to the bucket list for travelers who want to avoid the crowds and explore somewhere a bit different.Plus, because the internet (as everyone knows) is made of cats, we have the purrfect section on cat islands, cat cafes, cat temples and even a whole city called Cat.Perhaps you're just too busy this year for that round-the-world trip.

Readers love this series - More than 2,000 five-star reviews on Amazon and Goodreads.
Three Book Collection. First Three Books of the True Crime Case Histories Series (2019)

A quick word of warning. The true crime short stories within this three book collection are unimaginably gruesome. I start all of my True Crime books with a quick word of warning. Most news articles and television true crime shows skim over the vile details of truly horrible crimes. In my books I don't gloss over the facts, regardless of how disgusting they may be. I try to give my readers a clear and accurate description on just how demented the killers really were. I do my best not to leave anything out. The stories included in these books are not for the squeamish.What you are about to read are my first three books. The stories in this collection will make you realize just how fragile the human mind can be.

A sampling of the stories include:

The Canal Killer - A violent psychopath cuts off the head, hands, and feet of his girlfriends and dumps them in the canals of London and Rotterdam.

The Head in the Bucket - A drug kingpin chops off the head of one of his dealers and carries it around in a Home Depot bucket.

Captain Cash - Another drug dealer butchers an entire family so he can take over a man's fruit shipping business and transform it into a drug shipping business.

The Coffee Killer - A young woman, jealous of her rich socialite friend, poisons her by lacing her coffee with cyanide in a public coffee shop.

The Arizona Torso Killer - A petite trophy-wife shoots her husband, freezes his body, hacks him up with a jigsaw and dumps his torso in a dumpster behind a grocery store.

The Oxford Murder - A young college student strangles his girlfriend and crams her body into an eight-inch crawlspace beneath the stairs.

The Girl in the Barrel - A homeowner finds a fifty-five gallon barrel in the crawl space beneath his home. What they find inside the barrel unlocks a murder mystery dating back thirty years.

The Dexter Wannabe - A young man obsessed with the TV show Dexter lures unsuspecting victims to his ""kill room"" and keeps a detailed diary of the dismemberment of his prey.

The Murder of Elizabeth Olten - A fifteen-year-old girl wants to know what it feels like to kill a person.

Everything was laid out on the table: Dating. Politics. The Black church. Pop culture. Soon, other Black women began pulling up chairs to gather round. And so, the Truth’s Table podcast was born.In their literary debut, co-hosts Christina Edmondson, Michelle Higgins, and Ekemini Uwan offer stories by Black women and for Black women examining theology, politics, race, culture, and gender matters through a Christian lens. For anyone seeking to explore the spiritual dimensions of hot-button issues within the church, or anyone thirsty to deepen their faith, Truth’s Table provides exactly the survival guide we need, including: • Michelle Higgins’s unforgettable treatise revealing the way “racial reconciliation” is a spiritually bankrupt, empty promise that can often drain us of the ability to do real justice work• Ekemini Uwan’s exploration of Blackness as the image of God in the past, present, and future• Christina Edmondson’s reimagination of what a more just and liberating form of church discipline might look like—one that acknowledges and speaks to the trauma in the room These essays deliver a compelling theological re-education and pair the spiritual formation and political education necessary for Black women of faith.",Ekemini Uwan,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,417.60,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/510x-FoDlUL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715061948,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/truths-table-black-womens-musings-on-life-love-and-liberation

2215,9343400837404,"Unbound: 2,000 Years of Indian Women's Writing","Profound, exhilarating, haunting, angry and meditative, Unbound is a collection that will shatter stereotypes about women’s writing in India. Unbound is a collection of some of the most significant writing by Indian women over the past two thousand years. Divided into eleven sections, it encompasses writing on various aspects of life: spirituality, love, marriage, children, food, work, social and individual identity, battles, myths and fables, travel, and death. While many of the pieces are commentaries on the struggle that women undergo to overcome obstacles—social and political—all of them showcase the remarkable creative ability of their creators. The term ‘women’s writing’ has often been used to limit and stereotype the work of women writers. But it also has a larger and more constructive meaning, and that is the sense in which it has been used to inform and describe the context of the book. As Annie Zaidi explains in her introduction: ‘Women bring to their writing the truth of their bodies, and an enquiry into the different ways in which gender inequity shapes human experience.’ Selected from hundreds of novels, memoirs, essays, short story collections and volumes of poetry that were either written in English or that have been translated into English, the pieces in this collection include the most distinctive and powerful voices from every era. There are verses from the Therigatha, written by Buddhist nuns (circa 300 BCE), and writing by poet-saints like Andal, Avvaiyar, Lal Ded, Mirabai; modern classics by writers like Ajeet Cour, Amrita Pritam, Arundhati Roy, Attia Hosian, Bama, Bulbul Sharma, Irawati Karve, Ismat Chughtai, Kamala Das, Krishna Sobti, Mahasweta Devi, Manju Kapur, Mannu Bhandari, Mrinal Pande, Nayantara Sahgal, Pinki Virani, Qurratulain Hyder, Rashid Jahan, Romila Thapar, Sarojini Naidu, Saudamini Devi, Shivani; and powerful new voices from our time like Arundhathi Subramaniam, Nilanjana Roy, Nivedita Menon. Profound, exhilarating, haunting, angry and meditative, Unbound is a collection that will shatter stereotypes about women’s writing in India. Features: • Extracts included range across genres, languages and over 2,000 years. • Includes writing in English as well as from many Indian languages that have been translated into English. • Arranged thematically, this collection showcases the creative diversity that exists in women’s writing. • Provides an broad and comprehensive introduction to women’s writing in India.",Annie Zaidi,Books › Literature & Fiction › Anthologies,440.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51SnrUPLRbL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714994632,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/unbound-2-000-years-of-indian-womens-writing

When you hear the word ""monsters"", you probably conjure visions of gruesome and otherworldly creatures -- vampires, spirits, demons, and more.

Yet the most terrifying monsters in history aren't the ones you see on the big screen. No horror movie music cues when you cross paths with them or when they spot their first victim.

No, these vicious killers are much subtler. These monsters are people.

These are the killers who will walk away from a murder scene completely unphased by what they've done. The ones who pitilessly dump or hide bodies and then go about their day as usual.

While you're likely familiar with the famous serial killers who have had their faces plastered on every television screen, that's only a part of the picture. One reason that people find these criminals so compelling is because they can rest easy at night knowing justice has been served, and the world has been made a little safer. Yes, these killers are shocking and perverse, yet there's a sense of comfort in knowing they won't be hunting for victims any time soon. But what about those who go undetected?

In Unsolved Serial Killers, here is just a fraction of what you will discover:
Explorations of the cities and historical contexts of the killings, so you understand the atmosphere when they were taking place

With the arrest of a local arms dealer, Keshav Thakur, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), India’s external intelligence agency, is alerted about a plot to abduct the country’s top nuclear scientist, Hamid Ansari, who is in possession of a unique nuclear fusion formula.
Meanwhile, a military coup topples the democratic government of Myanmar. And a novel overriding device called Vita, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), India’s top defence agency, is stolen.
And so begins a race against time for R&amp;AW’s top agents, Vikram Aditya Singh and Ranbir Roy, through the power centre of the country, Delhi; the labyrinthine markets of Kathmandu; the failed state of Myanmar; the historic town of Multan, Pakistan; and the verdant coffee estates of south India.
With the dice loaded against them and time fast running out, Vikram and Ranbir will need to pull out all stops to get to the bottom of seemingly disparate mysteries: Who is the shadowy figure pulling the strings and just how far does his reach extend? Is Hamid Ansari truly what he seems? What deep conspiracy is Pakistan’s finance minister involved in?
Fasten your seatbelts for Siddharth Maheshwari’s thrilling ride through the shadowy world of power and espionage.

This book shows us how to apply this concept in the context of daily life and offers ideas on how to see it, embrace it and incorporate it into everyday thoughts, objects and situations.In a simple and accessible style, Wabi Sabi: The Wisdom in Imperfection shows you how embracing imperfections and impermanence frees you to become a better person, by reevaluating what ""better"" means--what really matters and what you truly want.

2266,9344866615580,Waiting for Shiva: Unearthing the Truth of Kashi’s Gyan Vapi,"Few places in the world carry the heavy burden of history as effortlessly as Kashi, or Varanasi, has. The holy city embodies the very soul of our civilization and personifies the resilience that we have displayed over centuries in the face of numerous adversities and fatal attacks.
Waiting for Shiva: Unearthing the Truth of Kashi’s Gyan Vapi recreates the history, antiquity and sanctity of Kashi as the abode of Bhagwan Shiva in the form of Vishweshwara, or Vishwanath. Shiva himself assured his devotees of salvation if they leave their mortal coils in the city. The book delves into the history of this selfmanifested swayambhu jyotirlinga shrine of Vishweshwara, which for centuries has been both a refuge for the devout and a target of the bloodiest waves of iconoclasm. However, each time an attempt was made to obliterate the temple by demolishing it, it managed to rise and prosper. Every iconoclastic storm was followed by an episode of persistence, tenacity and stubborn resolve. Shrines fell and shrines rose, but the Hindus of Kashi never gave up—not even once.
Waiting for Shiva documents these cataclysmic events in the temple’s history. The final death blow was dealt in 1669 by the Mughal despot Aurangzeb, who demolished the temple and erected few domes on the partially destroyed western wall to call it a mosque. The temple complex was desecrated and left strewn with ruins as a grim reminder of the humiliation and insult that Hindus had to face as a consequence of their holiest shrine being torn down to smithereens. The area that is now called the Gyan Vapi mosque and the surrounding land that lies adjacent to the new temple of Vishwanath, which came up towards the end of the 18th Century, has always been one of intense contestation. Bloody riots overran Varanasi over this issue multiple times in the past. During the colonial era, the doors of the British courts were knocked at to settle the occupancy issue, and they adjudicated the matter several times. PostIndependence, too, the desire to ‘liberate’ the complex has been seething in the Hindu imagination. A new suit filed in 2021 before the Varanasi civil court reopened a longfestering historical wound. Despite several appeals right up to the Supreme Court to dismiss the plaint, a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was ordered, which would lay bare the truth in its findings by the end of 2023.
Vikram Sampath’s latest offering retraces the long history of this bitterly disputed site and the dramatic twists and turns in the checkered past of this hoary shrine. Piecing together numerous documents and accounts—Vedic and Puranic texts, Sanskrit literary sources, Agama shastras, Jataka tales, Persian accounts, travelogues of foreigners, archival records and copious legal documents detailing the contestation from the British era to modern Indian courts—the book recreates, for the first time with facts and cogent arguments, this stormy history right up to the present times. The longsuppressed secrets that lay hidden in Gyan Vapi finally finds a voice through this book.",Vikram Sampath,Books › History › Indian History,445.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51uA_tMSCnL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062863,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/waiting-for-shiva-unearthing-the-truth-of-kashi-s-gyan-vapi

2281,9343438913820,WESTERN MEDIA NARRATIVES ON INDIA,"Western Media Narratives on India explores how cultural imperialism influences the Third-World nations. Media in the hands of the former colonizers that wish to maintain their sway has become a tool to dictate people's thoughts. Focussed on India, this narrative spans from the nation's independence in 1947 to the present day, scrutinizing the relentless targeting of Indian leadership by the dominant Western English media.  With time, these attacks have intensified, particularly on a resurgent India. In this book, the media's role during crises emerges as a central theme, with a spotlight on Covid-19. The Western media crafted a narrative portraying India's response to the disaster as chaotic, forecasting a staggering death toll reminiscent of the Spanish Flu of 1918.  The Western media's approach to India shows how the English press continues to perpetuate the West's long-held prejudices against India. Drawing heavily from history, the book critically analyses and unravels the origins and causes of this bias. While rooted in the Indian experience, the lessons derived hold universal relevance for any nation grappling with the shadows of colonization.

2290,9344821035292,Where Lost Girls Go: A totally addictive mystery and suspense novel (Detective Casey White Book 1),"“Help me,” the girl cries, alone in the forest, shivering in her nightgown, her small frame almost lost between the trees. “Please.”

When Detective Casey White discovers the body of a beautiful teenage girl in a white nightgown near the shoreline in North Carolina’s Outer Banks, a familiar fear floods through her. Could this be Hannah, her sweet, blue-eyed daughter snatched from home fourteen years ago? But it only takes one look to confirm that the girl with dark bruising around her throat is another family’s tragedy.

Putting her own grief aside, Casey digs into unsolved missing child cases in the area. The victim is Cheryl Parry, one of two little girls taken during a family beach vacation nine years ago. Her sister’s body was found strangled a week later, but someone has been keeping Cheryl alive—until now.

Fearful there may be other innocent lives in danger, Casey and her team work around the clock to trace the material from Cheryl’s nightgown, but hit a dead end and don’t know where to turn. Then, another teenager’s body is found in a nearby pine forest, dressed all in white. It’s suddenly clear that a twisted killer has been hiding in the Outer Banks for years, and he will strike again.

Casey painstakingly combs the forest soil for clues to the killer’s next move, but nothing prepares her for what she finds: a buried charm bracelet exactly matching one that her little Hannah always wore—right down to the broken star charm by the clasp…

An absolutely unputdownable crime thriller with twists and turns that will have you racing through the pages. Fans of Kendra Elliot, Rachel Caine and Robert Dugoni will be completely hooked.

2300,9344850034972,WHY I AM A HINDU,"In Why I Am a Hindu, one of India?s finest public intellectuals gives us a profound book about one of the world?s oldest and greatest religions. Starting with a close examination of his own belief in Hinduism, he ranges far and wide in his study of the faith. He talks about the Great Souls of Hinduism, Adi Shankara, Patanjali, Ramanuja, Swami Vivekananda, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and many others who made major contributions to the essence of Hinduism. He delves deep into Hinduism?s most important schools of thought (such as the Advaita Vedanta). He explains, in easily accessible language, important aspects and concepts of Hindu philosophy like the Purusharthas and Bhakti, masterfully summarizes the lessons of the Gita and Vivekananda?s ecumenism and explores with sympathy the ?Hinduism of habit? practised by ordinary believers. He looks at the myriad manifestations of political Hinduism in the modern era, including violence committed in the name of the faith by right-wing organizations and their adherents. He analyses Hindutva, explains its rise and dwells at length on the philosophy of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, its most significant ideologue. He is unsparing in his criticism of extremist ?bhakts? and unequivocal in his belief that everything that makes India a great and distinctive culture and country will be imperilled if religious ?fundamentalists? are allowed to take the upper hand. However, he also makes the point that it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy.A book that will be read and debated now and in the future, Why I Am a Hindu is a revelatory and original masterwork.",Shashi Tharoor,Books › Religion & Spirituality › Religious Studies,702.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51D8Gr7kRaL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062015,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/why-i-am-a-hindu

2302,9344854393116,Why to Die Before a Try,"The book 'Why to Die Before a Try' examines the profound despair of spiritual suicide—a condition where individuals abandon their core values, resulting in a metaphorical death of the soul. This decay emerges from the relentless pursuit of societal approval and superficial success, leading to a disconnection from one's true self. Despair is vividly illustrated through scenarios such as the loss of significant abilities or the hollow quest for fame, painting a stark picture of modern life's harsh realities.However, amidst this darkness, the text offers a glimmer of hope. Drawing on the timeless wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita, it advocates for a life centered on righteousness rather than rewards, suggesting a redemptive path forward through purposeful living. This philosophical approach serves as a counterpoint to despair, urging a return to authenticity and integrity.'Why to Die Before a Try' is both a critique and a call to action, prompting a deep re-evaluation of life's priorities and encouraging a fight against despair with compassion and self-reflection.",Ashutosh Sharma,"Kindle Store › Kindle eBooks › Health, Family & Personal Development",198.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/310ASgGIo-L._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715062234,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/why-to-die-before-a-try

2313,9343565070620,Woman Running in the Mountains,"Set in 1970s Japan, this tender and poetic novel about a young, single mother struggling to find her place in the world is an early triumph by a modern Japanese master.Alone at dawn, in the heat of midsummer, a young woman named Takiko Odaka departs on foot for the hospital to give birth to a baby boy. Her pregnancy, the result of a brief affair with a married man, is a source of sorrow and shame to her abusive parents. For Takiko, however, it is a cause for reverie. Her baby, she imagines, will be hers and hers alone, a challenge that she also hopes will free her. Takiko’s first year as a mother is filled with the intense bodily pleasures and pains that come from caring for a newborn. At first she seeks refuge in the company of other women—in the hospital, in her son’s nursery—but as the baby grows, her life becomes less circumscribed as she explores Tokyo, then ventures beyond the city into the countryside, toward a mountain that captures her imagination and desire for a wilder freedom.",Geraldine Harcourt,Books › Literature & Fiction › Contemporary Fiction,1120.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/41hNAliTreL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1714995882,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/woman-running-in-the-mountains

2319,9344823722268,"World War Two - Under The Shadow Of The Swastika, Lewis Helfand, Lalit Kumar Sharma (Campfire Graphic Novels)","This volume of Campfire's graphic history of World War II deals with the war in Europe from the rise of the Nazis through to May 1945 and VE Day. World War II shows the effects of the war on the soldiers, the refugees, the victims and protagonists of the most terrible conflict the world has ever known. In a world that is forgetting the lessons history has to teach, this book is a reminder of the horrors that come from intolerance.  In the 1930s, a great evil was rising in the heart of Europe, a threat unlike any seen before. German leader Adolf Hitler, a madman bent on world domination, was raising an army and growing more violent by the day. The world knew that Hitler had to be stopped. But fearing a war, this growing threat of Hitler's Nazi army was left unchecked. The world simply watched as Germany sank into darkness. The world merely prayed that war would not breach their borders. The world waited. And they waited too long. As cities fell to ruin and millions were slaughtered, the growing darkness of Hitler and his Nazi empire branched out far beyond Europe—to Asia and Africa and America—and soon threatened to claim the entire world. France, England, Russia, the United States… no single nation had the strength to combat this darkness, at least not on their own. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the one final, desperate hope was that all of these nations united together might muster the strength to save humanity.",Lalit Kumar Sharma,Books › Children's Books › Comics & Graphic Novels,500.00,https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0868/3490/5372/files/51g3iYBOnLL._SY445_SX342.jpg?v=1715060599,https://shopingai.myshopify.com/products/world-war-two-under-the-shadow-of-the-swastika-lewis-helfand-lalit-kumar-sharma-campfire-graphic-novels
